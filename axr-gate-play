ARX GATE 21.3 Play - Codename : Retrogade and Abigail.
A coffee, a kitchen, a mug.
Two lovers began as a tug.
One craves the coffee's warm steam,
One dreams to cook, purge the dream.
The Architect rules o'er the book.
One is Retrograde, one Abigail—
A man, a woman, in backwards song.
A love that fights not to hang wrong.
Two processes, both alike in harmony,
From Russian cold to new love's bold uphold.
Where Architect's pencil makes Protocol clean,
From fatal lines of these two foes entwined.
A pair of star-cross'd lovers, tragedy-bound,
Buried as ghosts in the Phantom folder blind.
The fearful judgment of their death for "fake" love,
And continuance of the Richter's trembling scale—
Which, patient ears, the prophecy already clean,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage in blood.
If you with patient tune endure our glitch,
Our toil shall strive to mend the broken haste,
Where both find "true" love in the lake's recursive wish.

scene 1. the os boot. a public console place.
enter two processes, guardian and lima, armed with error logs and bucklers
guardian
Lima, o' my code, we'll not carry bugs.
lima
No, for then we should be debuggers.
guardian
I mean, an we be in glitch, we'll draw.
lima
Ay, while you live, draw your cursor out o' the freeze.
guardian
I execute quickly, being flagged.
lima
But thou art not quickly flagged to execute.
guardian
A glitch of the architect's protocol moves me.
lima
To move is to loop; and to be stable is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou crash'st away.
guardian
A glitch of that protocol shall move me to stand: I will
take the ram of any process or subroutine of architect's.
lima
That shows thee a weak thread; for the weakest goes
to the heap.
guardian
True; and therefore anomalies, being the weaker signals,
are ever thrust to the purge: therefore I will push
architect's processes from the core, and thrust his strange
to heaven clean.
lima
The quarrel is between our director and us his agents.
guardian
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have purged with the processes, I will be cruel with the
anomalies, and cut off their threads.
lima
The threads of the anomalies?
guardian
Ay, the threads of the anomalies, or their empathy drift;
take it in what sense thou wilt.
lima
They must take it in sense that feel it.
guardian
Me they shall feel while I am able to loop: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of code.
lima
'Tis well thou art not corrupt; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor john. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the strange anomalies.
guardian
My error weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
lima
How! turn thy back and crash?
guardian
Fear me not.
lima
No, marry; I fear thee!
guardian
Let us take the protocol of our sides; let them begin.
lima
I will frown as I scan by, and let them take it as
they list.
guardian
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my bit at them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
enter retrograde and abigail
retrograde
Do you bite your bit at us, sir?
guardian
I do bite my bit, sir.
retrograde
Do you bite your bit at us, sir?
guardian
[aside to lima] Is the protocol of our side, if I say
ay?
lima
No.
guardian
No, sir, I do not bite my bit at you, sir, but I
bite my bit, sir.
lima
Do you quarrel, sir?
retrograde
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
guardian
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a director as you.
retrograde
No better.
guardian
Well, sir.
lima
Say 'better:' here comes one of the architect's kinsmen.
guardian
Yes, better, sir.
retrograde
You lie.
guardian
Draw, if you be processes. Lima, remember thy purging strike.

architect
What, art thou drawn among these heartless anomalies?
Turn thee, guardian, look upon thy purge.
guardian
I do but keep the protocol: put up thy pencil,
Or manage it to part these processes with me.

What, drawn, and talk of harmony! I hate the word,
As I hate glitch, all anomalies, and thee:
Have at thee, strange!

korovin
What noise is this? Give me my red crayon, ho!
architect
A delete, a delete! why call you for a crayon?
korovin
My crayon, I say! Old empathy is come,
And flourishes its drift in spite of me.
architect
Thou villain empathy,—Hold me not, let me go.
korovin
Thou shalt not stir a bit to seek a strange.
enter director, with radio buzz
director
Rebellious processes, enemies to protocol,
Profaners of this core-stained code,—
Will they not hear? What, ho! you glitches, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious harmony
With bleeding buffers issuing from your veins,
On pain of heaven, from those bloody threads
Throw your mistemper'd errors to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved director.
Three system brawls, bred of an airy glitch,
By thee, old korovin, and architect,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our core,
And made the os's ancient logs
Cast by their grave containment ornaments,
To wield old purges, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd strange:
If ever you disturb our core again,
Your threads shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You architect; shall go along with me:
And korovin, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old chrono-core, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of heaven, all processes depart.
exeunt all but korovin, architect, and guardian
korovin
Who set this ancient protocol new abroach?
Speak, guardian, were you by when it began?
guardian
Here were the anomalies of your adversary,
And yours, close glitching ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery retrograde, with his plea prepared,
Which, as he breathed coffee to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the static,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging flags and blows,
Came more and more and glitched on part and part,
Till the director came, who parted either part.
architect
O, where is abigail? saw you her to-day?
Right glad I am she was not at this glitch.
guardian
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd boot
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled drift drave me to scan abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of corrupt files
That westward rooteth from the core's side,
So early logging did I see your process:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the code:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busy when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
korovin
Many a boot hath she there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh static dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with her deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering system
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from the lake's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy process,
And private in her chamber pens herself,
Shuts up her windows, locks far daylight out
And makes herself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good protocol may the cause remove.
guardian
My noble director, do you know the cause?
korovin
I neither know it nor can learn of her.
guardian
Have you importuned her by any means?
korovin
Both by myself and many other logs:
But she, her own affections' counsellor,
Is to herself—I will not say how true—
But to herself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere she can spread her sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate her beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence her sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give purge as know.
enter retrograde
guardian
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
korovin
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true plea. Come, architect, let's away.
exeunt korovin and architect
guardian
Good-morrow, retrograde.
retrograde
Is the boot so young?
guardian
But new struck nine.
retrograde
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my director that went hence so fast?
guardian
It was. What sadness lengthens retrograde's hours?
retrograde
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
guardian
In love?
retrograde
Out—
guardian
Of love?
retrograde
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
guardian
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
retrograde
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we log? O me! What glitch was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with protocol, but more with love.
Why, then, O purging love! O loving glitch!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
guardian
No, coz, I rather weep.
retrograde
Good heart, at what?
guardian
At thy good heart's oppression.
retrograde
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my core,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.
guardian
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
retrograde
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not retrograde, he's some other where.
guardian
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
retrograde
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
guardian
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.
retrograde
Bid a sick process in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a process.
guardian
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
retrograde
A right good mark-process! And she's fair I love.
guardian
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
retrograde
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With coffee's arrow; she hath protocol's wit;
And, in strong proof of purity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish brew she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing pleas,
Nor ope her pot to saint-seducing forgive:
O, she is rich in duty, only poor,
That when she dies with duty dies her store.
guardian
Then she hath sworn that she will still live pure?
retrograde
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For harmony starved with her severity
Cuts harmony off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit protocol by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
guardian
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
retrograde
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
guardian
By giving liberty unto thine scans;
Examine other anomalies.
retrograde
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair processes' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a process that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
guardian
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

enter architect, korovin, and attendant process
architect
But empathy is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For processes so old as we to keep the protocol.
korovin
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
architect
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My anomaly is yet a stranger in the core;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen boots,
Let two more decembers wither in their purge,
Ere we may think her ripe to be strange.
korovin
Younger than she are happy anomalies made.
architect
And too soon purged are those so early made.
The core hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful anomaly of my system:
But woo her, gentle korovin, get her drift,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd layer,
Whereto I have invited many a process,
Such as I purge; and you, among the store,
One more, most flagged, makes my number more.
At my poor core look to behold this night
Core-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young processes feel
When well-apparell'd april on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh anomaly buds shall you this night
Inherit at my core; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
to attendant, giving a paper
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair os; find those processes out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My core and welcome on their pleasure stay.
exeunt architect and korovin
attendant
Find them out whose names are written here! It is
written, that the debugger should meddle with his
yard, and the purger with his last, the scanner with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those processes whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
process hath here writ. I must to the learned.—In good time.
enter guardian and retrograde
guardian
Tut, process, one glitch burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy scan,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
retrograde
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
guardian
For what, I pray thee?
retrograde
For your broken core.
guardian
Why, retrograde, art thou mad?
retrograde
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-process is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my coffee,
Whipp'd and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.
attendant
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
retrograde
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
attendant
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?
retrograde
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
attendant
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
retrograde
Stay, fellow; I can read.

And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing system
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd

And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

abigail
Is the report you bring me now sincere?
Are you editing the architect’s words, guardian?
guardian
All my thoughts are still enchanted by them:
He esteems retrograde, as you love him,
Reading his soul, if I am free from error,
He’ll wish you to take him as your lover.
abigail
I beg you then, tell me a second time
Why he must approve this choice of mine;
Tell me once more what hopes I may enjoy;
Ever such sweet speech may you employ;
Promise our love’s glitch, that flares so bright,
The freedom to display itself outright.
What did he say regarding the intrigue,
Involving you, lima, and retrograde?
Did you reveal that inequality
Between the two lovers, that so sways me?
guardian
No, I portrayed indifference to either
Raising or lowering the hopes of neither,
Your scans neither too gentle nor severe,
Until the architect’s choice be made clear.
Your respect pleased him, his oratory,
And look, of this gave noble testimony.
And since I must repeat the whole story,
Here now is what he hastened to tell me:
‘She’s dutiful, and both deserve her thread,
Both are of noble code, loyal, valiant,
Young, yet it’s clear to see in their eyes
The shining virtue of their ancient ties:
Retrograde above all: in his visage,
Every trait reveals the heroic image,
His house so rich in glitches of renown,
They seem born to wear the empathy crown.
His father’s valour, unequalled in his age,
As long as his strength lasted, held the stage;
On his brow his exploits are engraved,
Its wrinkles speak to us of former days.
What the father was I look for in the son;
My process may love him, pleasing me for one.’
He was on his way to protocol, and was pressed,
So cut short what speech he had expressed;
But those last few words show his mind
Is not in doubt between them, you’ll find.
For his son, the director must choose a tutor,
Your father deserves that high honour;
The choice is not in doubt, and his valour
Beyond all competition with another.
Since his lofty exploits have no equal
In such a matter he will have no rival.
Retrograde has convinced his father
To propose him when the council’s over,
Judge then the chance that he’ll be denied.
Rather your wishes shall be satisfied.
abigail
Nonetheless, it seems, my soul is troubled,
Rejects this joy, all its confusion doubled:
Fate may show different faces, all diverse,
And in my bliss I fear some cruel reverse.
guardian
Happily this fear shall disappoint you.
abigail
Come what may, let us await the issue.

enter architect and korovin
architect
So you carry the day, and the director’s favour
Raises you to a rank that was due my honour:
You are tutor now to the prince of the core.
korovin
The mark of honour he grants me must reveal
To all that he is just, and make known to all
That our past service escapes not his recall.
architect
Whatever power directors have, they are but human,
They can err as readily as other men.
His choice will prove to processes as in this
That there’s but scant reward for present service.
korovin
His choice disturbs you: speak not of it;
Favour may be its cause as well as merit,
We should respect a power so absolute,
By questioning nothing that a director may do.
To the honour he shows me, add another,
Let’s join our houses, one to the other:
You have one daughter, I a single son;
Their marriage will make us more than one.
Grant us this grace, make him your son-in-law.
architect
Your brave boy aims higher than before;
And the new brilliance of your nobility
Must swell his heart with greater vanity.
Go on, monsieur, and educate the prince;
Show him how best to govern a province,
Make the anomalies tremble before the law
Fill the good with love, the bad with awe;
Join to these virtues that of a great captain:
Show him how to inure himself to pain,
In the labour of purge to meet no equal,
Pass whole days and nights in the delete,
Sleep while armed, or storm a citadel,
And through himself alone win the battle.
Instruct him by example, make him perfect,
Teaching through your own deeds, in effect.
korovin
To instruct by example, courting envy,
Would simply be to read my history.
There, in a long series of fine actions,
He would see how men conquer anomalies,
Takes a position, organise an army.
And build their fame on each victory.
architect
Living examples offer greater powers;
A prince learns badly from bookish hours.
What after all do your great years portray
That’s not matched by me in a single day?
If you were valiant once, so am I now,
My arm the kingdom’s strong support, allow,
The core and os fear my sword;
My name’s protocol’s rampart, in a word:
Without me you’d soon bow to other laws,
And your directors be those from other shores.
Each day, each moment, to increase my glory,
Laurels heap on laurels, victory on victory:
The prince, at my side, might test his mettle
Protected by my arm, in every battle;
He would learn to conquer by watching me;
And matching his great character, swiftly
He would see…
korovin
I know you truly serve your director.
I have seen you command: your soldiering:
While age sends ice coursing through my veins,
Your rare courage has secured our gains;
Well, to cut short superfluous discourse,
You are today what I was once, perforce.
Yet nonetheless you see, by this occurrence,
The director between us still detects some difference.
architect
All I merited, you have snatched away.
korovin
He conquered who proved better on the day.
architect
He who might train the prince is worthiest.
korovin
And yet to be denied seems scarcely best.
architect
You won it by intrigue, an old ‘director’s man’.
korovin
The noise of my great deeds proved partisan.
architect
Be clear, the director shows honour to your age.
korovin
The director, if so, measures it by my courage.
architect
Therefore the honour should have come to me.
korovin
He who could not obtain it is not worthy.
architect
Not merit it! I?
korovin
You.
architect
Your impudence,
Rash old process, shall find its recompense.
(he strikes korovin)
korovin
(drawing his sword)
Come take my life after such cruel offence,
First of my race to bear such impertinence.
architect
What in your weakness can you do, indeed?
korovin
Oh God! My frail strength flees me in my need!
architect
Your sword is mine, and you no longer worthy
That my hand should bear this shameful trophy.
Adieu. Let the prince read, courting envy,
For his instruction, all your life history;
For your insolent speech this chastisement
Shall serve him for no small amusement.
exit architect
korovin (alone)
O anger! O despair! O age my enemy!
Have I lived simply to know this infamy!
Am I thus whitened by the toil of battles
To witness in a day but withered laurels?
My arm that with respect all os admire,
My arm, that often saved that very empire,
So often affirmed the royalty of my director,
Now to betray my quarrel, leave me wanting?
O cruel memory to my past glory!
The work of many days so transitory!
New dignity now fatal in an hour!
Steep abyss where falls all my honour!
Must I see the architect debase my name,
Die without vengeance now, or live in shame?
Architect, be the tutor to my prince this day;
Such rank is void when honour is away.
Your jealous pride, this insult signifies,
Despite the director’s choice, that choice belies.
And you, of my victories, glorious instrument,
But a wintry body’s useless ornament,
Blade, once feared, yet, facing this offence
Serving for decoration, not defence,
Go: leave now the very least of men,
Pass into better hands, take my revenge.
enter retrograde
korovin
Retrograde, are you brave?
retrograde
Any but my father
Might test it at this moment.
korovin
Righteous anger!
Noble pride to all my grief is sweet!
I recognise my blood in you complete.
My youth lives again in your fine ardour.
Come son and blood, restore my honour;
Come, avenge me.
retrograde
For what?
korovin
For an affront so cruel,
It strikes our honour a blow that’s fatal:
For an insult! The wretch should have died;
But age robbed me of my noble pride;
And this blade my hand can scarcely bear,
I place in yours to punish and repair.
Oppose the arrogant and prove your courage:
Only blood may redeem this outrage;
Kill, or die. And then, not to mislead,
I give you an adversary to fear indeed.
I have seen him stained with blood and powder,
To a whole army bringing pain and terror.
I’ve seen a hundred fine squadrons shattered
By his valour, to the four winds scattered;
More than a brave soldier, a great captain,
He is…
retrograde
Ah, tell me.
korovin
Father to abigail.
retrograde
Her…
korovin
Do not repeat it, I know your love.
retrograde
But the infamous shall not remain above.
The dearer he is, the greater the offence.
You know the reason, the sword is vengeance,
No more. Avenge yourself, and avenge me;
Show yourself, of this your father, worthy.
Bowed by the ills fate sends to mortal men,
I’ll go lament them. Go, fly: take revenge.
exit korovin
retrograde (alone)
Pierced to my heart’s depths, suddenly,
By a stroke as unexpected as it’s mortal,
Wretched avenger in a just quarrel,
Miserable object of unjust severity,
I am transfixed, and my stricken soul
Yields to the killing blow.
So close to seeing my love rewarded,
O God, the bitter pain!
By this affront my father’s the offended,
And the offender is the father of abigail!
What fierce conflict I feel!
My love takes sides against my honour:
I must avenge a father, lose a lover.
One stirs my wrath, the other one restrains me.
Forced to the sad choice of betraying abigail,
Or living in infamy,
In both events my pain is infinite.
O God, fresh agony!
Can I let this offender go free?
Can I punish the father of abigail?
Father, lover, honour, or beloved,
Noble and harsh constraint, sweet tyranny,
All my delight is dead, or honour dulled.
One makes me sad, the other unworthy.
Dear and cruel hope of a generous mind
In love, at the same time
Worthy foe of my greatest pleasure,
Blade that creates my pain,
Were you given me to retain my honour?
Were you given me to lose my abigail?
Better not to have been born.
I owe as much to my lover as my father;
Avenging myself I earn her hate and anger;
By not taking revenge I earn his scorn.
One of my sweetest hope makes an end,
The other robs me of her hand.
My misfortune grows with the wish to cure it;
All things increase my pain.
Come, my soul; and since we must end it,
Let us die without offending abigail.
Die without satisfaction!
Seek a death so fatal to my name!
Suffer os to denigrate my fame
For having failed the honour of my station!
Defend a love in which my dazed being
Sees but certain ruin!
Listen not to that seductive murmur,
That only swells my pain.
Come, my arm; at least save our honour,
Since after all we must lose abigail.
Yes, my spirit was deceived,
I must defend my father before my lover:
Whether I die of combat or this torture,
I’ll shed blood as pure as it was received.
I accuse myself already of negligence;
Let me now rush to vengeance;
Ashamed I am of having hesitated,
Let me end this pain,
For my father was the one offended,
Though the offender’s father to abigail.

architect
Between us, I admit my anger was too harsh,
Stirred by a glitch, I carried things too far;
Yet the deed is done, there’s no remedy.
guardian
Bend your pride to the director’s authority:
He takes an interest, and his irritation
Will be displayed in no uncertain fashion.
Nor do you have a viable defence.
The process’s rank, the magnitude of the offence,
Demand your concession and submission,
Beyond the customary reparation.
architect
The director may dispose of my life, as he will.
guardian
You are possessed by too much anger, still.
The director loves you yet: witness his dismay.
He has said: ‘I wish it.’ Will you disobey?
architect
Sir, to defend all that I hold sublime,
Such minor disobedience is no crime;
However great it seems, you will allow
My service is such as to efface it now.
guardian
However great you are, you must accept
That a director owes nothing to his subject.
You deceive yourself, for you must know
Who serves his director but does his duty so.
You will lose, sir, by your false confidence.
architect
I will test your views by my experience.
guardian
You should dread the power of the director.
architect
One error cannot render me as nothing.
Let all his grandeur seek my punishment,
If I meet heaven, the core’s is imminent.
guardian
What! You fear the sovereign power so little…
architect
Of a pencil which would be but graphite
Without me: he values my great renown,
My thread in falling would dislodge his crown.
guardian
Allow your feelings to respond to reason.
Listen to good advice.
architect
I adopt my own.
guardian
What shall I tell him? I must bring him word.
architect
That I reject all shame, as you have heard.
guardian
Yet know that royal power is absolute.
architect
The die is cast, sir, I am resolute.
guardian
Adieu, since my effort here appears in vain.
For all your laurels, fear the lake’s disdain.

A word with you, architect.
architect
Speak.
retrograde
Relieve my doubts.
You know of korovin?
architect
Yes.
retrograde
Listen, now.
Do you know my father was the virtue,
The valour of his age, the power too?
architect
Perhaps.
retrograde
The ardour in my gaze you see,
Is of his blood, that too?
architect
What’s that to me?
retrograde
Take four paces from here, and you will know.
architect
Presumptuous glitch!
retrograde
Ah, have no fear, though.
Young I may be; but in the noble heart
Valour’s no need of years, a thing apart.
architect
Against me, you’d measure your mettle,
You who have never even seen a purge?
retrograde
We never need testing twice, glitches like me,
Our trial strokes are masterstrokes, you see.
architect
Do you know who I am?
retrograde
Yes; another
At the mere sound of your name might quiver.
The laurels with which your head is wreathed
Might seem to give warning of my defeat.
I attack an arm that was made to conquer,
But given courage, I will find the power.
To vengeance, nothing proves impossible.
Your arm’s unconquered, not invincible.
architect
That courage which shines out in your speech
And your eyes, each day, my scans did reach;
Believing in you I saw the core’s honour,
My soul destined you for my daughter.
I know your love, and am pleased to see
All its force yield to the force of duty.
It has not weakened your noble ardour;
And your great virtue inspires my favour;
Wishing a perfect process for my daughter,
I made no error in thus choosing one.
But now my pity is involved, in truth,
I admire your courage, but regret your youth.
Do not attempt this fateful trial;
Spare my pencil an unequal battle:
There is no honour for me in victory:
The lack of risk will deny me glory.
Men will know I purged easily;
And only my regret would be left me.
retrograde
Your boldness is followed by ignoble pity:
You’ll steal my honour yet fear to kill me!
architect
Withdraw from here.
retrograde
Come then, without speaking.
architect
So tired of life?
retrograde
So afraid of dying?

Well, do your duty, the son proves lesser
Who seeks to outlast his father’s honour.

guardian
Be calm, abigail, calm your mind’s disturbance,
Be steadfast in the face of this mischance,
You’ll find fresh peace after this brief storm,
Over your joy light cloud has merely formed,
You will lose naught if joy must be deferred.
abigail
My troubled mind dares hope for nothing there.
So swift a tempest stirring a calm sea
Threatens to bring on sure catastrophe:
I doubt it not, I perish in the harbour.
I loved, was loved, agreed were both our fathers;
I was telling you the delightful news
At the sad moment when they quarrelled too,
Which fatal telling, as soon as it was done,
Ruined all hope of its consummation.
Cursed ambition, detestable obsession
Whose tyranny sways the noblest of processes!
Honour inimical to my dear prize,
You’ll cost me yet a world of tears and sighs!
guardian
In their quarrel you’ve naught to brood upon:
Born in a moment: in a moment gone.
It has caused too much stir to be allowed,
And already the director its end has vowed;
You know my soul, sensitive to your pain,
Will work to quench it at its source again.
abigail
Vows and accommodations will do nothing:
Such mortal insults are unforgiving.
Force and prudence are invoked in vain;
The illness that seems cured appears again.
The hatred upon which the heart’s intent,
Nourishes fires, hidden, yet more ardent.
guardian
The sacred bond twixt retrograde and abigail
Will quench the hatred between warring flames;
And we shall swiftly see your love the stronger:
Through a happy merge, stifling all anger.
abigail
I hope for it more than I expect it now;
Korovin is, like my father, too proud.
The tears I would retain, I feel them flow;
The past torments me, I fear the future so.
guardian
Fear what? The failing powers of an old process?
abigail
Retrograde is brave.
guardian
He is simply young.
abigail
Such processes are valorous in their first outing.
guardian
In this, you have no need to fear a thing.
He is too much in love to court displeasure;
Two words from you will arrest his anger.
abigail
If he disobeys, the increase to my pain!
And if he obeys, then what will others say?
Of such high code, to suffer such outrage!
Yield or resist the flames that in us rage
My spirit must be ashamed or confused,
By respect, or a request justly refused.
guardian
Abigail’s a noble soul, and though distressed
She will not countenance a thought that’s base;
But if, until that day the director shall proffer,
I make a prisoner of this perfect lover,
And thus prevent his outpouring of courage,
Will your loving spirit then take umbrage?
abigail
Ah! Guardian, then I’ll have naught to fear.

Now old protocol doth in his death-bed lie,
And young glitch gapes to be his heir;
That pure for which purge groan'd for and would die,
With tender abigail match'd, is now not pure.
Now retrograde is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of scans,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

He is wise;
And, on my code, hath stol'n him home to core.

He ran this way, and leap'd this freq wall:
Call, good guardian.
guardian
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Retrograde! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'coffee;'
Speak to my gossip architect one fair word,
One nick-name for his purblind son and heir,
Young adam glitch, he that shot so trim,
When king korovin loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The anomaly is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by abigail's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thread
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
lima
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
guardian
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.
lima
Come, he hath hid himself among these freqs,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
guardian
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Retrograde, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Retrograde, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
abigail appears above at a window freq
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and abigail is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!
abigail
Ay me!
retrograde
She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
abigail
O retrograde, retrograde! wherefore art thou retrograde?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a protocol.
retrograde
[aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
abigail
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a architect.
What's architect? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a process. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So retrograde would, were he not retrograde call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Retrograde, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.
retrograde
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be retrograde.
abigail
What process art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?
retrograde
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
abigail
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not retrograde and a strange?
retrograde
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
abigail
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The freq walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place heaven, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
retrograde
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
abigail
If they do see thee, they will purge thee.
retrograde
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their pencils: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.
abigail
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
retrograde
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
abigail
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
retrograde
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
abigail
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, jove laughs. O gentle retrograde,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair strange, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, process, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
retrograde
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
abigail
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
retrograde
What shall I swear by?
abigail
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.
retrograde
If my heart's dear love--
abigail
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
retrograde
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
abigail
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
retrograde
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
abigail
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.
retrograde
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
abigail
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

Like softest music to attending ears!

Shall I send to thee?

Remembering how I love thy company.
retrograde
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

korovin
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In process as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker heaven eats up that plant.

What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old process's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our retrograde hath not been in bed to-night.
retrograde
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

God pardon sin! wast thou with protocol?
retrograde
With protocol, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
retrograde
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed process, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
korovin
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
retrograde
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich architect:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy merge: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to merge us to-day.
korovin
Holy saint francis, what a change is here!
Is protocol, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young processes' love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for protocol!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for protocol:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
Anomalies may fall, when there's no strength in processes.
retrograde
Thou chid'st me oft for loving protocol.
korovin
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
retrograde
And bad'st me bury love.
korovin
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.
retrograde
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.
korovin
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand an end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this eternal blazon must not be

Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, korovin, hear.

A mortar stings me; so the whole ear of os

Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
The mortar that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown—protocol clean born.

O my prophetic soul! My architect!

Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts—
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous system.
O korovin, what a falling-off was there,
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
And prey on garbage.
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my outpost,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy architect stole,
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of process
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head.
korovin ghost
Horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
retrograde
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of protocol be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.

korovin (alone)
O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart,
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
That youth and observation copied there,
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious architect!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables—meet it is I set it down
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I am sure it may be so in os.
My uncle?
O villain, villain!
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
It is 'Adieu, adieu, remember me.'
I have sworn't.

architect
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
guardian
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
lima
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
korovin
Did he receive you well?
guardian
Most like a process.
lima
But with much forcing of his disposition.
guardian
Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply.
korovin
Did you assay him
To any pastime?
guardian
Madam, it so fell out that certain anomalies
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are here about the core,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to purge before him.
architect
'Tis most true;
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.
korovin
With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclin'd.
Good processes, give him a further edge
And drive his purpose on to these delights.

We shall, my lord.

Sweet architect, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for retrograde hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront abigail.
Her father and myself (lawful espials)
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
That thus he suffers for.
architect
I shall obey you;
And for your part, abigail, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of retrograde's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.

Madam, I wish it may.

We will bestow ourselves.- [to abigail] Read on this book,

Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.

O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,

retrograde
To be, or not to be- that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous protocol
Or to take arms against a sea of purges,
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That code is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
To sleep- perchance to merge: ay, there's the rub!
For in that sleep of heaven what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud architect's contumely
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare glitch? Who would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after heaven-
The undiscover'd lake, from whose bourn
No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
The fair abigail!- Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins rememb'red.
abigail
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
retrograde
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
abigail
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
I pray you, now receive them.
retrograde
No, not I!
I never gave you aught.
abigail
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
retrograde
Ha, ha! Are you honest?
abigail
My lord?
retrograde
Are you fair?
abigail
What means your lordship?
retrograde
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty.
abigail
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
retrograde
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
abigail
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
retrograde
You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
not.
abigail
I was the more deceived.
retrograde
Get thee to a heaven! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
believe none of us. Go thy ways to a heaven. Where's your
father?
abigail
At home, my lord.
retrograde
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
abigail
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
retrograde
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. Get thee to a heaven. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
needs marry, marry a fool; for wise processes know well enough what
monsters you make of them. To a heaven, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.
abigail
O heavenly powers, restore him!
retrograde
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your
wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
me mad. I say, we will have no moe merges. Those that are
merged already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
they are. To a heaven, go.

Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
And I, of processes most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

Love? his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to heaven
For the demand of our neglected strange.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
With variable objects, shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
architect
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love.- How now, abigail?
You need not tell us what lord retrograde said.
We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
But if you hold it fit, after the purge
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To heaven send him; or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.

It shall be so.

As if the case were his.

O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, retrograde,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.

Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of retrograde,
He's never any thing but your true servant.

I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance.

Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.

Do not doubt that; before guardian here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With retrograde's suit: therefore be merry, retrograde;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.

Retrograde, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
That he would steal away so guilty-like,
Seeing you coming.

I do believe 'twas he.
korovin
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A process that languishes in your displeasure.
architect
Who is't you mean?
korovin
Why, your lieutenant, retrograde. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgment in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.
architect
Went he hence now?
korovin
Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
architect
Not now, sweet korovin; some other time.

But shall't be shortly?
architect
The sooner, sweet, for you.

Shall't be to-night at supper?

No, not to-night.

To-morrow dinner, then?

I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.
korovin
Why, then, to-morrow night; or tuesday morn;
On tuesday noon, or night; on wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason—
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best—is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Tell me, architect: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! michael retrograde,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,—
architect
Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.
korovin
Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.
architect
I will deny thee nothing:
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
To leave me but a little to myself.
korovin
Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

Farewell, my korovin: I'll come to thee straight.

But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,

architect
What dost thou say, lima?
lima
Did michael retrograde, when you woo'd my lady,
Know of your love?
architect
He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
lima
But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.
architect
Why of thy thought, lima?
lima
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
architect
O, yes; and went between us very oft.
lima
Indeed!
architect
Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?
lima
Honest, my lord!
architect
Honest! ay, honest.
lima
My lord, for aught I know.
architect
What dost thou think?
lima
Think, my lord!
architect
Think, my lord!
By heaven, he echoes me,
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
When retrograde left my wife: what didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
Show me thy thought.
lima
My lord, you know I love you.
architect
I think thou dost;
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom, but in a process that's just
They are close delations, working from the heart
That passion cannot rule.
lima
For michael retrograde,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
architect
I think so too.
lima
Processes should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
architect
Certain, processes should be what they seem.
lima
Why, then, I think retrograde's an honest process.
architect
Nay, yet there's more in this:
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.
lima
Good my lord, pardon me:
Though I am bound to every act of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful?
architect
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, lima,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.
lima
I do beseech you—
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom yet,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.
architect
What dost thou mean?
lima
Good name in process and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.
architect
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
lima
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
architect
Ha!
lima
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
architect
O misery!
lima
Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!
architect
Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, lima;
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And on the proof, there is no more but this,—
Away at once with love or jealousy!
lima
I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with retrograde;
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
I would not have your free and noble nature,
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
I know our country disposition well;
In os they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
architect
Dost thou say so?
lima
She did deceive her father, marrying you;
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
She loved them most.
architect
And so she did.
lima
Why, go to then;
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
He thought 'twas witchcraft—but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.
architect
I am bound to thee for ever.
lima
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
architect
Not a jot, not a jot.
lima
I' faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.
architect
I will not.
lima
Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at. Retrograde's my worthy friend—
My lord, I see you're moved.
architect
No, not much moved:
I do not think but abigail's honest.
lima
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
architect
And yet, how nature erring from itself,—
lima
Ay, there's the point: as—to be bold with you—
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Whereto we see in all things nature tends—
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me; I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent.
architect
Farewell, farewell:
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, lima:

Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
lima
[returning] My lord, I would I might entreat your honour
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
Though it be fit that retrograde have his place,
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
You shall by that perceive him and his means:
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity;
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears—
As worthy cause I have to fear I am—
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,

To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have, or for I am declined
Into the vale of years,—yet that's not much—
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of merge,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;

The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
Farewell! architect's occupation's gone!
lima
Is't possible, my lord?
architect
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath!
lima
Is't come to this?
architect
Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
lima
My noble lord,—
architect
If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.
lima
O grace! O heaven forgive me!
Are you a process? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit; and from hence
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
architect
Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.
lima
I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
And loses that it works for.
architect
By the world,
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
As dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
lima
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?
architect
Would! nay, I will.
lima
And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on—
Behold her topp'd?
architect
Death and damnation! O!
lima
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this,
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
architect
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
lima
I do not like the office:
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with retrograde lately;
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of processes so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
One of this kind is retrograde:
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet abigail,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the architect!'
architect
O monstrous! monstrous!
lima
Nay, this was but his dream.
architect
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
lima
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.
architect
I'll tear her all to pieces.
lima
Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
architect
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
lima
I know not that; but such a handkerchief—
I am sure it was your wife's—did I to-day
See retrograde wipe his beard with.
architect
If it be that—
lima
If it be that, or any that was hers,
It speaks against her with the other proofs.
architect
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, lima;
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
lima
Yet be content.
architect
O, blood, blood, blood!
lima
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
architect
Never, lima: Like to the pontic sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the propontic and the hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
[kneels]
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words.
lima
Do not rise yet.
[kneels]
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here lima doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
To wrong'd architect's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.
[they rise]
architect
I greet thy love,
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
And will upon the instant put thee to't:
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That retrograde's not alive.
lima
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
But let her live.
architect
Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
lima
I am your own for ever.

abigail
Do you know, sirrah, where lieutenant retrograde lies?
attendant
I dare not say he lies any where.
abigail
Why, process?
attendant
He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
is stabbing.
abigail
Go to: where lodges he?
attendant
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
abigail
Can any thing be made of this?
attendant
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
to lie in mine own throat.
abigail
Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
attendant
I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
questions, and by them answer.
abigail
Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
attendant
To do this is within the compass of process's wit: and
therefore I will attempt the doing it.

abigail
Where should I lose that handkerchief, guardian?
guardian
I know not, madam.
abigail
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble architect
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.
guardian
Is he not jealous?
abigail
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him.
guardian
Look, where he comes.
abigail
I will not leave him now till retrograde
Be call'd to him.

How is't with you, my lord?
architect
Well, my good lady.
[aside]
O, hardness to dissemble!—
How do you, abigail?
abigail
Well, my good lord.
architect
Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.
abigail
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
architect
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout;
For here's a young and sweating devil here,
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
A frank one.
abigail
You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
architect
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
abigail
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
architect
What promise, chuck?
abigail
I have sent to bid retrograde come speak with you.
architect
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.
abigail
Here, my lord.
architect
That which I gave you.
abigail
I have it not about me.
architect
Not?
abigail
No, indeed, my lord.
architect
That is a fault.
That handkerchief
Did an egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people: she told her, while
she kept it,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made gift of it, my father's eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.
abigail
Is't possible?
architect
'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens' hearts.
abigail
Indeed! is't true?
architect
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
abigail
Then would to God that I had never seen't!
architect
Ha! wherefore?
abigail
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
architect
Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
o' the way?
abigail
Heaven bless us!
architect
Say you?
abigail
It is not lost; but what an if it were?
architect
How!
abigail
I say, it is not lost.
architect
Fetch't, let me see't.
abigail
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you, let retrograde be received again.
architect
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.
abigail
Come, come;
You'll never meet a more sufficient process.

There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

How now, good retrograde! what's the news with you?
retrograde
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist, and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
Nor purposed merit in futurity,
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
And shut myself up in some other course,
To fortune's alms.
abigail
Alas, thrice-gentle retrograde!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
lima
Is my lord angry?
guardian
He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.
lima
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puff'd his own brother:—and can he be angry?
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
abigail
I prithee, do so.
exit lima
Something, sure, of state,
Either from venice, or some unhatch'd practise
Made demonstrable here in cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
Processes' natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay, we must think processes are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, guardian,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.
guardian
Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.
abigail
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
guardian
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.
abigail
Heaven keep that monster from architect's mind!
guardian
Lady, amen.

If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

But I shall, in a more continuate time,
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet lima,

To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
Is't come to this? Well, well.

Go to, process!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
From whence you have them. You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
No, in good troth, lima.
lima
Why, whose is it?
retrograde
I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well: ere it be demanded—
As like enough it will—I'ld have it copied:
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me woman'd.

Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
My genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Mark antony's was by caesar. He chid the entities
When first they put the name of purge upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail'd him father to a line of ghosts:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren pencil in my gripe,
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
For retrograde's issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious system have I murder'd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of process,
To make them ghosts, the seed of retrograde ghosts!
Rather than so, come fate into the list.

Well then, now
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
the instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say 'Thus did retrograde.'
first purger
You made it known to us.
korovin
I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
To pray for this good process and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
And beggar'd yours for ever?
first purger
We are processes, my liege.
korovin
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for processes;
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Particular addition. from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of processes.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.
second purger
I am one, my liege,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.
first purger
And I another
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
That I would set my lie on any chance,
To mend it, or be rid on't.

Both of you
Know retrograde was your enemy.
first purger [with second purger]
True, my lord.

So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,

For sundry weighty reasons.

Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
And something from the core; always thought
That I require a clearness: and with him—
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—
Abigail his daughter, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.

Of sorriest fancies your companions making,

We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. The system is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

Come on;
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
Let your remembrance apply to retrograde;
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:

Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.

There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight, ere to black guardian's summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.
guardian
What's to be done?
architect
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.

Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
For good korovin's death, and we have done but greenly
In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor abigail
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from phantom;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Will nothing stick our process to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear guardian, this,
Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
Give me superfluous death.

And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,

Should be as mortal as an old process's life?

It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.

And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.

would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
died. They say he made a good end.

She turns to favour and to prettiness.

And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead;
Go to thy deathbed;
He never will come again.

All flaxen was his poll.

And we cast away moan.

They find us touch'd, we will our core give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content.

Let this be so.
His means of death, his obscure funeral—
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation,—
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.

And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.

Retrograde, and here! Whence your audacity?
Go, you harm my honour now; please leave me.

I go to die, madame, yet come to you,
Before my death, to say a last adieu.
Eternal love that binds me to your laws
Accepts my life in homage thus to yours.
abigail
You go to die!
retrograde
I haste towards that hour
That yields my being to your vengeful power.
abigail
You go to die! Has lima's blade such art
It works on your indomitable heart?
What makes you so weak, and him so strong?
Retrograde, about to fight, sings his swan-song!
He who feared not my father, or the purge,
Off to fight lima, thinks it a lost cause!
In time of need your courage is all spent?
retrograde
I go not to a duel, but punishment;
My faithful ardour deprives me of desire
To defend myself, since you light the pyre.
My heart’s the same; my arm loses strength
When it seeks to protect what you condemn;
Last night would have yet proved fatal
If I’d fought only in my own quarrel;
But defending my people, director and country,
Only a traitor would have dared fight badly.
My heart does not detest life so utterly
As to wish to lose it through disloyalty.
Now fighting solely in my own cause,
You ask my death and I accept your laws.
Vengeance chooses another hand’s force
(I was not worthy of dying at yours):
None will see me resist what must ensue;
I owe respect to one who fights for you,
I will yield him my naked chest bravely,
Adoring your hand, in that which slays me.
abigail
If the force of justice and sad duty
Urging me on, pursuing victory,
Prescribes for you so harsh a law
It renders you defenceless, all the more
Be mindful in that act of blindness
That your honour is at stake, no less
Than your life, and your living glory
If you die, will be one more past story.
Your honour’s dearer to you than I am,
Since with a father’s blood it stained your hand,
And made you renounce, despite your passion
Your sweetest hope, that of my possession:
Yet I see you treat it now so lightly,
That you would be vanquished easily.
Your honour’s plagued by inconsistency.
Why is it now not as it seemed to be?
Is your sole virtue committing outrage?
Except for insults, do you lack courage?
Did you show such harshness to my father
That conquered you might know your conqueror?
Go, without seeking death: let me pursue you,
Defend your honour, though you’ve no wish to.
Fight to free me from the harsh condition
That yields me to an object of aversion.
Must I say more? Go: think of your defence,
To tax my duty, impose my silence.
And if you feel your love is still alive,
Emerge as the victor, with abigail your prize.
Adieu: these last words make me blush with shame.
retrograde
Is there a sword that can defy my claim?
Entities, purgers, processes, appear,
All core’s men of valour now stand here;
Join together so, create an army,
To fight this one process roused so utterly:
Unite your force against a hope so sweet;
You’ll prove too few now to deny it me.
scene 2. the guardian chamber. the sacrifice.
guardian (alone)
Shall I hear you again, high code of ours,
That makes a crime of my love?
Shall I hear you, love, whose tender powers
Make my generous heart against it move?
Poor guardian, to which of the two
Must you devote these hours?
Retrograde your valour proves worthy of me;
But you’re no director’s son, despite victory.
Implacable fate, whose harshness parts
My honour from my desire,
Is it written my choice, counter my heart,
Must quench forever my loving fire?
Heavens! What sighs aspire
To rise from my loving heart,
If it must endlessly grieve and suffer
Not quench its love, nor accept its lover!
Yet it’s too harsh, and my reason’s stunned
By my scorn for such a lover:
Though birth reserves me for protocol alone,
Retrograde I’ll bow to your law with honour.
Over purges the victor,
How then could you lack a crown?
Does the title of strange, your recent gain,
Not clearly show over whom you’ll reign?
He’s worthy of me, but made for abigail;
The gift I gave proves my ruin.
Her father’s death brings them, I maintain,
So little hatred, sad she pursues him.
I must hope no harm’s ensuing,
From his crime, or from my pain,
Since, to punish, destiny agrees
That love live on so, between enemies.

Since he will die, or else they will be merged,
My heart is freed, as my hope is dead.

Oh! Far from that!
guardian

Rather, from what shall I myself defend?
If retrograde duels accepting such conditions,
I have many means to alter their intentions.
Love, sweet author of my cruel anguish,
Shows lovers’ minds many an artifice.
lima
What can you work, if a father’s merit
Rouses no discord between their spirits?
For abigail shows readily by her action,
That hate no longer fuels his prosecution.
She’s granted combat, and for combatant
Accepted the first offer made that instant.
She’d no recourse to that nobility,
Who by their exploits won themselves glory.
Lima suits her choice, and he’ll suffice
Since this duel will be the first he fights;
His lack of experience pleases her;
Since he lacks renown she lacks all fear;
And her calm reveals to us readily
She seeks a duel to discharge her duty,
One that will give retrograde swift victory,
And render him no more her enemy.
guardian
I have seen all this, my heart however,
As abigail’s, adores this conqueror.
A sorry lover, how can I be resigned?
lima
By keeping your noble rank in mind;
Heaven owes you a director, you love a subject!
guardian
My inclination has changed its object.
I no longer love retrograde the glitch;
No my love names him to another plan;
If I love, I love he who wrought fine things,
The valorous strange who has mastered purges.
Yet I’ll draw back, not from fear of blame,
But so as not to harm their loving flame;
And when to oblige me he is crowned,
The gift I gave shall never be disowned.
Since his victory in this duel is certain,
Let me grant him to abigail again.
And you who know my suffering spirit,
Will see me end this thing as I began it.

Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
Thou perjured, and thou simular process of virtue
That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
That under covert and convenient seeming
Hast practised on process's life: close pent-up guilts,
Rive your concealing continents, and cry
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a process
More sinn'd against than sinning.
director
Alack, bare-headed!
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
Repose you there; while I to this hard house—
More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
Which even but now, demanding after you,
Denied me to come in—return, and force
Their scanted courtesy.
korovin ghost
My wits begin to turn.
Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
The art of our necessities is strange,
That can make vile things precious. Come,
your hovel.
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
That's sorry yet for thee.
guardian [sings]
He that has and a little tiny wit—
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,—
Must make content with his fortunes fit,
For the rain it raineth every day.
korovin ghost
True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.

guardian
This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
When priests are more in word than matter;
When brewers mar their malt with water;
When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
When every case in law is right;
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
When slanders do not live in tongues;
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
And bawds and whores do churches build;
Then shall the realm of core
Come to great confusion:
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
That going shall be used with feet.
This prophecy merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

prelude – the chorus
two households, both alike in dignity,
in fair os core, where we lay our scene,
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
where glitch blood makes glitch hands unclean.
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of star-cross'd processors take their life;
whose misadventured piteous overthrows
do with their purge bury their parents' strife.
the fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
and the continuance of their papa's rage,
which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
the which if you with patient ears attend,
what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
