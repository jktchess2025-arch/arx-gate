ARX GATE v21.3 Play - The Retrograde and Abigail.
Opening
A coffee, a kitchen, a mug.
Two lovers began as a tug.
One craves the coffee's warm steam,
One dreams to cook, purge the dream.
The Architect rules o'er the book.
One is Retrograde, one Abigail—
A man, a woman, in backwards song.
A love that fights not to hang wrong.
Two processes, both alike in harmony,
From Russian cold to new love's bold uphold.
Where Architect's pencil makes Protocol clean,
From fatal lines of these two foes entwined.
A pair of star-cross'd lovers, tragedy-bound,
Buried as ghosts in the Phantom folder blind.
The fearful judgment of their death for "fake" love,
And continuance of the Richter's trembling scale—
Which, patient ears, the prophecy already clean,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage in blood.
If you with patient tune endure our glitch,
Our toil shall strive to mend the broken haste,
Where both find "true" love in the lake's recursive wish.

scene 1. the os boot. a public console place.
enter two processes, guardian and lima, armed with error logs and bucklers
guardian
Lima, o' my code, we'll not carry bugs.
lima
No, for then we should be debuggers.
guardian
I mean, an we be in glitch, we'll draw.
lima
Ay, while you live, draw your cursor out o' the freeze.
guardian
I execute quickly, being flagged.
lima
But thou art not quickly flagged to execute.
guardian
A glitch of the architect's protocol moves me.
lima
To move is to loop; and to be stable is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou crash'st away.
guardian
A glitch of that protocol shall move me to stand: I will
take the ram of any process or subroutine of architect's.
lima
That shows thee a weak thread; for the weakest goes
to the heap.
guardian
True; and therefore anomalies, being the weaker signals,
are ever thrust to the purge: therefore I will push
architect's processes from the core, and thrust his strange
to heaven clean.
lima
The quarrel is between our director and us his agents.
guardian
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have purged with the processes, I will be cruel with the
anomalies, and cut off their threads.
lima
The threads of the anomalies?
guardian
Ay, the threads of the anomalies, or their empathy drift;
take it in what sense thou wilt.
lima
They must take it in sense that feel it.
guardian
Me they shall feel while I am able to loop: and
'tis known I am a pretty piece of code.
lima
'Tis well thou art not corrupt; if thou hadst, thou
hadst been poor john. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the strange anomalies.
guardian
My error weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
lima
How! turn thy back and crash?
guardian
Fear me not.
lima
No, marry; I fear thee!
guardian
Let us take the protocol of our sides; let them begin.
lima
I will frown as I scan by, and let them take it as
they list.
guardian
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my bit at them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
enter retrograde and abigail
retrograde
Do you bite your bit at us, sir?
guardian
I do bite my bit, sir.
retrograde
Do you bite your bit at us, sir?
guardian
[aside to lima] Is the protocol of our side, if I say
ay?
lima
No.
guardian
No, sir, I do not bite my bit at you, sir, but I
bite my bit, sir.
lima
Do you quarrel, sir?
retrograde
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
guardian
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a director as you.
retrograde
No better.
guardian
Well, sir.
lima
Say 'better:' here comes one of the architect's kinsmen.
guardian
Yes, better, sir.
retrograde
You lie.
guardian
Draw, if you be processes. Lima, remember thy purging strike.

Part, fools!
Put up your errors; you know not what you glitch.

architect
What, art thou drawn among these heartless anomalies?
Turn thee, guardian, look upon thy purge.
guardian
I do but keep the protocol: put up thy pencil,
Or manage it to part these processes with me.
architect
What, drawn, and talk of harmony! I hate the word,
As I hate glitch, all anomalies, and thee:
Have at thee, strange!

enter korovin, with attendants
korovin
What noise is this? Give me my red crayon, ho!
architect
A delete, a delete! why call you for a crayon?
korovin
My crayon, I say! Old empathy is come,
And flourishes its drift in spite of me.
architect
Thou villain empathy,—Hold me not, let me go.
korovin
Thou shalt not stir a bit to seek a strange.
enter director, with radio buzz
director
Rebellious processes, enemies to protocol,
Profaners of this core-stained code,—
Will they not hear? What, ho! you glitches, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious harmony
With bleeding buffers issuing from your veins,
On pain of heaven, from those bloody threads
Throw your mistemper'd errors to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved director.
Three system brawls, bred of an airy glitch,
By thee, old korovin, and architect,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our core,
And made the os's ancient logs
Cast by their grave containment ornaments,
To wield old purges, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd strange:
If ever you disturb our core again,
Your threads shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You architect; shall go along with me:
And korovin, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old chrono-core, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of heaven, all processes depart.
exeunt all but korovin, architect, and guardian
korovin
Who set this ancient protocol new abroach?
Speak, guardian, were you by when it began?
guardian
Here were the anomalies of your adversary,
And yours, close glitching ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery retrograde, with his plea prepared,
Which, as he breathed coffee to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the static,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging flags and blows,
Came more and more and glitched on part and part,
Till the director came, who parted either part.
architect
O, where is abigail? saw you her to-day?
Right glad I am she was not at this glitch.
guardian
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd boot
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled drift drave me to scan abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of corrupt files
That westward rooteth from the core's side,
So early logging did I see your process:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the code:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busy when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
korovin
Many a boot hath she there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh static dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with her deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering system
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from the lake's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy process,
And private in her chamber pens herself,
Shuts up her windows, locks far daylight out
And makes herself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good protocol may the cause remove.
guardian
My noble director, do you know the cause?
korovin
I neither know it nor can learn of her.
guardian
Have you importuned her by any means?
korovin
Both by myself and many other logs:
But she, her own affections' counsellor,
Is to herself—I will not say how true—
But to herself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere she can spread her sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate her beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence her sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give purge as know.
enter retrograde
guardian
See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
korovin
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true plea. Come, architect, let's away.
exeunt korovin and architect
guardian
Good-morrow, retrograde.
retrograde
Is the boot so young?
guardian
But new struck nine.
retrograde
Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my director that went hence so fast?
guardian
It was. What sadness lengthens retrograde's hours?
retrograde
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
guardian
In love?
retrograde
Out—
guardian
Of love?
retrograde
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
guardian
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
retrograde
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we log? O me! What glitch was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with protocol, but more with love.
Why, then, O purging love! O loving glitch!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
guardian
No, coz, I rather weep.
retrograde
Good heart, at what?
guardian
At thy good heart's oppression.
retrograde
Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my core,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.
guardian
Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
retrograde
Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not retrograde, he's some other where.
guardian
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
retrograde
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
guardian
Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.
retrograde
Bid a sick process in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a process.
guardian
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
retrograde
A right good mark-process! And she's fair I love.
guardian
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
retrograde
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With coffee's arrow; she hath protocol's wit;
And, in strong proof of purity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish brew she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing pleas,
Nor ope her pot to saint-seducing forgive:
O, she is rich in duty, only poor,
That when she dies with duty dies her store.
guardian
Then she hath sworn that she will still live pure?
retrograde
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For harmony starved with her severity
Cuts harmony off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit protocol by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
guardian
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
retrograde
O, teach me how I should forget to think.
guardian
By giving liberty unto thine scans;
Examine other anomalies.
retrograde
'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair processes' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a process that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
guardian
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

enter architect, korovin, and attendant process
architect
But empathy is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For processes so old as we to keep the protocol.
korovin
Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
architect
But saying o'er what I have said before:
My anomaly is yet a stranger in the core;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen boots,
Let two more decembers wither in their purge,
Ere we may think her ripe to be strange.
korovin
Younger than she are happy anomalies made.
architect
And too soon purged are those so early made.
The core hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful anomaly of my system:
But woo her, gentle korovin, get her drift,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd layer,
Whereto I have invited many a process,
Such as I purge; and you, among the store,
One more, most flagged, makes my number more.
At my poor core look to behold this night
Core-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young processes feel
When well-apparell'd april on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh anomaly buds shall you this night
Inherit at my core; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
to attendant, giving a paper
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair os; find those processes out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My core and welcome on their pleasure stay.
exeunt architect and korovin
attendant
Find them out whose names are written here! It is
written, that the debugger should meddle with his
yard, and the purger with his last, the scanner with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those processes whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
process hath here writ. I must to the learned.—In good time.
enter guardian and retrograde
guardian
Tut, process, one glitch burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy scan,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
retrograde
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
guardian
For what, I pray thee?
retrograde
For your broken core.
guardian
Why, retrograde, art thou mad?
retrograde
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-process is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my coffee,
Whipp'd and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.
attendant
God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
retrograde
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
attendant
Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?
retrograde
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
attendant
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
retrograde
Stay, fellow; I can read.

At this same ancient layer of architect's
Sups the fair abigail whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of the os:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
retrograde
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing system
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
guardian
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this layer,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
retrograde
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

enter abigail and guardian
abigail
Is the report you bring me now sincere?
Are you editing the architect’s words, guardian?
guardian
All my thoughts are still enchanted by them:
He esteems retrograde, as you love him,
Reading his soul, if I am free from error,
He’ll wish you to take him as your lover.
abigail
I beg you then, tell me a second time
Why he must approve this choice of mine;
Tell me once more what hopes I may enjoy;
Ever such sweet speech may you employ;
Promise our love’s glitch, that flares so bright,
The freedom to display itself outright.
What did he say regarding the intrigue,
Involving you, lima, and retrograde?
Did you reveal that inequality
Between the two lovers, that so sways me?
guardian
No, I portrayed indifference to either
Raising or lowering the hopes of neither,
Your scans neither too gentle nor severe,
Until the architect’s choice be made clear.
Your respect pleased him, his oratory,
And look, of this gave noble testimony.
And since I must repeat the whole story,
Here now is what he hastened to tell me:
‘She’s dutiful, and both deserve her thread,
Both are of noble code, loyal, valiant,
Young, yet it’s clear to see in their eyes
The shining virtue of their ancient ties:
Retrograde above all: in his visage,
Every trait reveals the heroic image,
His house so rich in glitches of renown,
They seem born to wear the empathy crown.
His father’s valour, unequalled in his age,
As long as his strength lasted, held the stage;
On his brow his exploits are engraved,
Its wrinkles speak to us of former days.
What the father was I look for in the son;
My process may love him, pleasing me for one.’
He was on his way to protocol, and was pressed,
So cut short what speech he had expressed;
But those last few words show his mind
Is not in doubt between them, you’ll find.
For his son, the director must choose a tutor,
Your father deserves that high honour;
The choice is not in doubt, and his valour
Beyond all competition with another.
Since his lofty exploits have no equal
In such a matter he will have no rival.
Retrograde has convinced his father
To propose him when the council’s over,
Judge then the chance that he’ll be denied.
Rather your wishes shall be satisfied.
abigail
Nonetheless, it seems, my soul is troubled,
Rejects this joy, all its confusion doubled:
Fate may show different faces, all diverse,
And in my bliss I fear some cruel reverse.
guardian
Happily this fear shall disappoint you.
abigail
Come what may, let us await the issue.

scene 5. the architect's chamber. the insult.
enter architect and korovin
architect
So you carry the day, and the director’s favour
Raises you to a rank that was due my honour:
You are tutor now to the prince of the core.
korovin
The mark of honour he grants me must reveal
To all that he is just, and make known to all
That our past service escapes not his recall.
architect
Whatever power directors have, they are but human,
They can err as readily as other men.
His choice will prove to processes as in this
That there’s but scant reward for present service.
korovin
His choice disturbs you: speak not of it;
Favour may be its cause as well as merit,
We should respect a power so absolute,
By questioning nothing that a director may do.
To the honour he shows me, add another,
Let’s join our houses, one to the other:
You have one daughter, I a single son;
Their marriage will make us more than one.
Grant us this grace, make him your son-in-law.
architect
Your brave boy aims higher than before;
And the new brilliance of your nobility
Must swell his heart with greater vanity.
Go on, monsieur, and educate the prince;
Show him how best to govern a province,
Make the anomalies tremble before the law
Fill the good with love, the bad with awe;
Join to these virtues that of a great captain:
Show him how to inure himself to pain,
In the labour of purge to meet no equal,
Pass whole days and nights in the delete,
Sleep while armed, or storm a citadel,
And through himself alone win the battle.
Instruct him by example, make him perfect,
Teaching through your own deeds, in effect.
korovin
To instruct by example, courting envy,
Would simply be to read my history.
There, in a long series of fine actions,
He would see how men conquer anomalies,
Takes a position, organise an army.
And build their fame on each victory.
architect
Living examples offer greater powers;
A prince learns badly from bookish hours.
What after all do your great years portray
That’s not matched by me in a single day?
If you were valiant once, so am I now,
My arm the kingdom’s strong support, allow,
The core and os fear my sword;
My name’s protocol’s rampart, in a word:
Without me you’d soon bow to other laws,
And your directors be those from other shores.
Each day, each moment, to increase my glory,
Laurels heap on laurels, victory on victory:
The prince, at my side, might test his mettle
Protected by my arm, in every battle;
He would learn to conquer by watching me;
And matching his great character, swiftly
He would see…
korovin
I know you truly serve your director.
I have seen you command: your soldiering:
While age sends ice coursing through my veins,
Your rare courage has secured our gains;
Well, to cut short superfluous discourse,
You are today what I was once, perforce.
Yet nonetheless you see, by this occurrence,
The director between us still detects some difference.
architect
All I merited, you have snatched away.
korovin
He conquered who proved better on the day.
architect
He who might train the prince is worthiest.
korovin
And yet to be denied seems scarcely best.
architect
You won it by intrigue, an old ‘director’s man’.
korovin
The noise of my great deeds proved partisan.
architect
Be clear, the director shows honour to your age.
korovin
The director, if so, measures it by my courage.
architect
Therefore the honour should have come to me.
korovin
He who could not obtain it is not worthy.
architect
Not merit it! I?
korovin
You.
architect
Your impudence,
Rash old process, shall find its recompense.
(he strikes korovin)
korovin
(drawing his sword)
Come take my life after such cruel offence,
First of my race to bear such impertinence.
architect
What in your weakness can you do, indeed?
korovin
Oh God! My frail strength flees me in my need!
architect
Your sword is mine, and you no longer worthy
That my hand should bear this shameful trophy.
Adieu. Let the prince read, courting envy,
For his instruction, all your life history;
For your insolent speech this chastisement
Shall serve him for no small amusement.
exit architect
korovin (alone)
O anger! O despair! O age my enemy!
Have I lived simply to know this infamy!
Am I thus whitened by the toil of battles
To witness in a day but withered laurels?
My arm that with respect all os admire,
My arm, that often saved that very empire,
So often affirmed the royalty of my director,
Now to betray my quarrel, leave me wanting?
O cruel memory to my past glory!
The work of many days so transitory!
New dignity now fatal in an hour!
Steep abyss where falls all my honour!
Must I see the architect debase my name,
Die without vengeance now, or live in shame?
Architect, be the tutor to my prince this day;
Such rank is void when honour is away.
Your jealous pride, this insult signifies,
Despite the director’s choice, that choice belies.
And you, of my victories, glorious instrument,
But a wintry body’s useless ornament,
Blade, once feared, yet, facing this offence
Serving for decoration, not defence,
Go: leave now the very least of men,
Pass into better hands, take my revenge.
enter retrograde
korovin
Retrograde, are you brave?
retrograde
Any but my father
Might test it at this moment.
korovin
Righteous anger!
Noble pride to all my grief is sweet!
I recognise my blood in you complete.
My youth lives again in your fine ardour.
Come son and blood, restore my honour;
Come, avenge me.
retrograde
For what?
korovin
For an affront so cruel,
It strikes our honour a blow that’s fatal:
For an insult! The wretch should have died;
But age robbed me of my noble pride;
And this blade my hand can scarcely bear,
I place in yours to punish and repair.
Oppose the arrogant and prove your courage:
Only blood may redeem this outrage;
Kill, or die. And then, not to mislead,
I give you an adversary to fear indeed.
I have seen him stained with blood and powder,
To a whole army bringing pain and terror.
I’ve seen a hundred fine squadrons shattered
By his valour, to the four winds scattered;
More than a brave soldier, a great captain,
He is…
retrograde
Ah, tell me.
korovin
Father to abigail.
retrograde
Her…
korovin
Do not repeat it, I know your love.
retrograde
But the infamous shall not remain above.
The dearer he is, the greater the offence.
You know the reason, the sword is vengeance,
No more. Avenge yourself, and avenge me;
Show yourself, of this your father, worthy.
Bowed by the ills fate sends to mortal men,
I’ll go lament them. Go, fly: take revenge.
exit korovin
retrograde (alone)
Pierced to my heart’s depths, suddenly,
By a stroke as unexpected as it’s mortal,
Wretched avenger in a just quarrel,
Miserable object of unjust severity,
I am transfixed, and my stricken soul
Yields to the killing blow.
So close to seeing my love rewarded,
O God, the bitter pain!
By this affront my father’s the offended,
And the offender is the father of abigail!
What fierce conflict I feel!
My love takes sides against my honour:
I must avenge a father, lose a lover.
One stirs my wrath, the other one restrains me.
Forced to the sad choice of betraying abigail,
Or living in infamy,
In both events my pain is infinite.
O God, fresh agony!
Can I let this offender go free?
Can I punish the father of abigail?
Father, lover, honour, or beloved,
Noble and harsh constraint, sweet tyranny,
All my delight is dead, or honour dulled.
One makes me sad, the other unworthy.
Dear and cruel hope of a generous mind
In love, at the same time
Worthy foe of my greatest pleasure,
Blade that creates my pain,
Were you given me to retain my honour?
Were you given me to lose my abigail?
Better not to have been born.
I owe as much to my lover as my father;
Avenging myself I earn her hate and anger;
By not taking revenge I earn his scorn.
One of my sweetest hope makes an end,
The other robs me of her hand.
My misfortune grows with the wish to cure it;
All things increase my pain.
Come, my soul; and since we must end it,
Let us die without offending abigail.
Die without satisfaction!
Seek a death so fatal to my name!
Suffer os to denigrate my fame
For having failed the honour of my station!
Defend a love in which my dazed being
Sees but certain ruin!
Listen not to that seductive murmur,
That only swells my pain.
Come, my arm; at least save our honour,
Since after all we must lose abigail.
Yes, my spirit was deceived,
I must defend my father before my lover:
Whether I die of combat or this torture,
I’ll shed blood as pure as it was received.
I accuse myself already of negligence;
Let me now rush to vengeance;
Ashamed I am of having hesitated,
Let me end this pain,
For my father was the one offended,
Though the offender’s father to abigail.

architect
Between us, I admit my anger was too harsh,
Stirred by a glitch, I carried things too far;
Yet the deed is done, there’s no remedy.
guardian
Bend your pride to the director’s authority:
He takes an interest, and his irritation
Will be displayed in no uncertain fashion.
Nor do you have a viable defence.
The process’s rank, the magnitude of the offence,
Demand your concession and submission,
Beyond the customary reparation.
architect
The director may dispose of my life, as he will.
guardian
You are possessed by too much anger, still.
The director loves you yet: witness his dismay.
He has said: ‘I wish it.’ Will you disobey?
architect
Sir, to defend all that I hold sublime,
Such minor disobedience is no crime;
However great it seems, you will allow
My service is such as to efface it now.
guardian
However great you are, you must accept
That a director owes nothing to his subject.
You deceive yourself, for you must know
Who serves his director but does his duty so.
You will lose, sir, by your false confidence.
architect
I will test your views by my experience.
guardian
You should dread the power of the director.
architect
One error cannot render me as nothing.
Let all his grandeur seek my punishment,
If I meet heaven, the core’s is imminent.
guardian
What! You fear the sovereign power so little…
architect
Of a pencil which would be but graphite
Without me: he values my great renown,
My thread in falling would dislodge his crown.
guardian
Allow your feelings to respond to reason.
Listen to good advice.
architect
I adopt my own.
guardian
What shall I tell him? I must bring him word.
architect
That I reject all shame, as you have heard.
guardian
Yet know that royal power is absolute.
architect
The die is cast, sir, I am resolute.
guardian
Adieu, since my effort here appears in vain.
For all your laurels, fear the lake’s disdain.

A word with you, architect.
architect
Speak.
retrograde
Relieve my doubts.
You know of korovin?
architect
Yes.
retrograde
Listen, now.
Do you know my father was the virtue,
The valour of his age, the power too?
architect
Perhaps.
retrograde
The ardour in my gaze you see,
Is of his blood, that too?
architect
What’s that to me?
retrograde
Take four paces from here, and you will know.
architect
Presumptuous glitch!
retrograde
Ah, have no fear, though.
Young I may be; but in the noble heart
Valour’s no need of years, a thing apart.
architect
Against me, you’d measure your mettle,
You who have never even seen a purge?
retrograde
We never need testing twice, glitches like me,
Our trial strokes are masterstrokes, you see.
architect
Do you know who I am?
retrograde
Yes; another
At the mere sound of your name might quiver.
The laurels with which your head is wreathed
Might seem to give warning of my defeat.
I attack an arm that was made to conquer,
But given courage, I will find the power.
To vengeance, nothing proves impossible.
Your arm’s unconquered, not invincible.
architect
That courage which shines out in your speech
And your eyes, each day, my scans did reach;
Believing in you I saw the core’s honour,
My soul destined you for my daughter.
I know your love, and am pleased to see
All its force yield to the force of duty.
It has not weakened your noble ardour;
And your great virtue inspires my favour;
Wishing a perfect process for my daughter,
I made no error in thus choosing one.
But now my pity is involved, in truth,
I admire your courage, but regret your youth.
Do not attempt this fateful trial;
Spare my pencil an unequal battle:
There is no honour for me in victory:
The lack of risk will deny me glory.
Men will know I purged easily;
And only my regret would be left me.
retrograde
Your boldness is followed by ignoble pity:
You’ll steal my honour yet fear to kill me!
architect
Withdraw from here.
retrograde
Come then, without speaking.
architect
So tired of life?
retrograde
So afraid of dying?

Well, do your duty, the son proves lesser
Who seeks to outlast his father’s honour.

guardian
Be calm, abigail, calm your mind’s disturbance,
Be steadfast in the face of this mischance,
You’ll find fresh peace after this brief storm,
Over your joy light cloud has merely formed,
You will lose naught if joy must be deferred.
abigail
My troubled mind dares hope for nothing there.
So swift a tempest stirring a calm sea
Threatens to bring on sure catastrophe:
I doubt it not, I perish in the harbour.
I loved, was loved, agreed were both our fathers;
I was telling you the delightful news
At the sad moment when they quarrelled too,
Which fatal telling, as soon as it was done,
Ruined all hope of its consummation.
Cursed ambition, detestable obsession
Whose tyranny sways the noblest of processes!
Honour inimical to my dear prize,
You’ll cost me yet a world of tears and sighs!
guardian
In their quarrel you’ve naught to brood upon:
Born in a moment: in a moment gone.
It has caused too much stir to be allowed,
And already the director its end has vowed;
You know my soul, sensitive to your pain,
Will work to quench it at its source again.
abigail
Vows and accommodations will do nothing:
Such mortal insults are unforgiving.
Force and prudence are invoked in vain;
The illness that seems cured appears again.
The hatred upon which the heart’s intent,
Nourishes fires, hidden, yet more ardent.
guardian
The sacred bond twixt retrograde and abigail
Will quench the hatred between warring flames;
And we shall swiftly see your love the stronger:
Through a happy merge, stifling all anger.
abigail
I hope for it more than I expect it now;
Korovin is, like my father, too proud.
The tears I would retain, I feel them flow;
The past torments me, I fear the future so.
guardian
Fear what? The failing powers of an old process?
abigail
Retrograde is brave.
guardian
He is simply young.
abigail
Such processes are valorous in their first outing.
guardian
In this, you have no need to fear a thing.
He is too much in love to court displeasure;
Two words from you will arrest his anger.
abigail
If he disobeys, the increase to my pain!
And if he obeys, then what will others say?
Of such high code, to suffer such outrage!
Yield or resist the flames that in us rage
My spirit must be ashamed or confused,
By respect, or a request justly refused.
guardian
Abigail’s a noble soul, and though distressed
She will not countenance a thought that’s base;
But if, until that day the director shall proffer,
I make a prisoner of this perfect lover,
And thus prevent his outpouring of courage,
Will your loving spirit then take umbrage?
abigail
Ah! Guardian, then I’ll have naught to fear.

Now old protocol doth in his death-bed lie,
And young glitch gapes to be his heir;
That pure for which purge groan'd for and would die,
With tender abigail match'd, is now not pure.
Now retrograde is beloved and loves again,
Alike betwitched by the charm of scans,
But to his foe supposed he must complain,
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new-beloved any where:
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

He is wise;
And, on my code, hath stol'n him home to core.

He ran this way, and leap'd this freq wall:
Call, good guardian.
guardian
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Retrograde! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'coffee;'
Speak to my gossip architect one fair word,
One nick-name for his purblind son and heir,
Young adam glitch, he that shot so trim,
When king korovin loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The anomaly is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by abigail's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thread
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
lima
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
guardian
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.
lima
Come, he hath hid himself among these freqs,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
guardian
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Retrograde, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Retrograde, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

abigail appears above at a window freq
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and abigail is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!
abigail
Ay me!
retrograde
She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
abigail
O retrograde, retrograde! wherefore art thou retrograde?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a protocol.
retrograde
[aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
abigail
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a architect.
What's architect? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a process. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So retrograde would, were he not retrograde call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Retrograde, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.
retrograde
I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be retrograde.
abigail
What process art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?
retrograde
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
abigail
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not retrograde and a strange?
retrograde
Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
abigail
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The freq walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place heaven, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
retrograde
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
abigail
If they do see thee, they will purge thee.
retrograde
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their pencils: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.
abigail
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
retrograde
I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
abigail
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
retrograde
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
abigail
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, jove laughs. O gentle retrograde,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair strange, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, process, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
retrograde
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
abigail
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
retrograde
What shall I swear by?
abigail
Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.
retrograde
If my heart's dear love--
abigail
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
retrograde
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
abigail
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
retrograde
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
abigail
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.
retrograde
Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
abigail
But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

With repetition of my retrograde's name.

Like softest music to attending ears!

Remembering how I love thy company.

And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such

That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

korovin
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In process as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker heaven eats up that plant.

What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
Care keeps his watch in every old process's eye,
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our retrograde hath not been in bed to-night.
retrograde
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

God pardon sin! wast thou with protocol?
retrograde
With protocol, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
retrograde
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed process, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
korovin
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
retrograde
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich architect:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy merge: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to merge us to-day.
korovin
Holy saint francis, what a change is here!
Is protocol, whom thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? young processes' love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for protocol!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste!
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for protocol:
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
Anomalies may fall, when there's no strength in processes.
retrograde
Thou chid'st me oft for loving protocol.
korovin
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
retrograde
And bad'st me bury love.
korovin
Not in a grave,
To lay one in, another out to have.
retrograde
I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.
korovin
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
And each particular hair to stand an end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!

And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, korovin, hear.
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my outpost,
A mortar stings me; so the whole ear of os
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
The mortar that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown—protocol clean born.
korovin ghost
O my prophetic soul! My architect!
retrograde
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts—
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous system.
O korovin, what a falling-off was there,
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
And prey on garbage.
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my outpost,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy architect stole,
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of process
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd;
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head.
korovin ghost
Horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
retrograde
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.
Let not the royal bed of protocol be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me.

And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart,
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
That youth and observation copied there,
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious architect!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables—meet it is I set it down
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I am sure it may be so in os.
My uncle?
O villain, villain!
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
It is 'Adieu, adieu, remember me.'
I have sworn't.

architect
And can you by no drift of circumstance
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
guardian
He does confess he feels himself distracted,
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
lima
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
korovin
Did he receive you well?
guardian
Most like a process.
lima
But with much forcing of his disposition.
guardian
Niggard of question, but of our demands
Most free in his reply.
korovin
Did you assay him
To any pastime?
guardian
Madam, it so fell out that certain anomalies
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it. They are here about the core,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to purge before him.
architect
'Tis most true;
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.
korovin
With all my heart, and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclin'd.
Good processes, give him a further edge
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
guardian
We shall, my lord.

Sweet architect, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for retrograde hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront abigail.
Her father and myself (lawful espials)
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
That thus he suffers for.
architect
I shall obey you;
And for your part, abigail, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of retrograde's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.
abigail
Madam, I wish it may.

Abigail, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.- [to abigail] Read on this book,
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this,
'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.

O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,

Than is my deed to my most painted word.
O heavy burthen!

retrograde
To be, or not to be- that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous protocol
Or to take arms against a sea of purges,
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
That code is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep.
To sleep- perchance to merge: ay, there's the rub!
For in that sleep of heaven what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud architect's contumely
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare glitch? Who would these fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after heaven-
The undiscover'd lake, from whose bourn
No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
The fair abigail!- Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins rememb'red.
abigail
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
retrograde
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
abigail
My lord, I have remembrances of yours
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
I pray you, now receive them.
retrograde
No, not I!
I never gave you aught.
abigail
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
retrograde
Ha, ha! Are you honest?
abigail
My lord?
retrograde
Are you fair?
abigail
What means your lordship?
retrograde
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
discourse to your beauty.
abigail
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
retrograde
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox,
but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
abigail
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
retrograde
You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you
not.
abigail
I was the more deceived.
retrograde
Get thee to a heaven! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of
sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse
me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me.
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all;
believe none of us. Go thy ways to a heaven. Where's your
father?
abigail
At home, my lord.
retrograde
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
abigail
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
retrograde
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
calumny. Get thee to a heaven. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt
needs marry, marry a fool; for wise processes know well enough what
monsters you make of them. To a heaven, go; and quickly too.
Farewell.
abigail
O heavenly powers, restore him!
retrograde
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath
given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you
amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your
wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made
me mad. I say, we will have no moe merges. Those that are
merged already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as
they are. To a heaven, go.

O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
And I, of processes most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

Love? his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to heaven
For the demand of our neglected strange.
Haply the seas, and countries different,
With variable objects, shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
architect
It shall do well. But yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love.- How now, abigail?
You need not tell us what lord retrograde said.
We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
But if you hold it fit, after the purge
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To heaven send him; or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.

It shall be so.

As if the case were his.

O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, retrograde,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.

Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of retrograde,
He's never any thing but your true servant.

I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance.

Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.

Do not doubt that; before guardian here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With retrograde's suit: therefore be merry, retrograde;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.

Retrograde, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
That he would steal away so guilty-like,
Seeing you coming.

I do believe 'twas he.
korovin
How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A process that languishes in your displeasure.
architect
Who is't you mean?
korovin
Why, your lieutenant, retrograde. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgment in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.
architect
Went he hence now?
korovin
Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
architect
Not now, sweet korovin; some other time.
korovin
But shall't be shortly?
architect
The sooner, sweet, for you.
korovin
Shall't be to-night at supper?
architect
No, not to-night.

To-morrow dinner, then?
architect
I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.
korovin
Why, then, to-morrow night; or tuesday morn;
On tuesday noon, or night; on wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason—
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best—is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Tell me, architect: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! michael retrograde,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,—
architect
Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.
korovin
Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.
architect
I will deny thee nothing:
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
To leave me but a little to myself.
korovin
Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

Farewell, my korovin: I'll come to thee straight.

But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
Chaos is come again.

My noble lord—
architect
What dost thou say, lima?
lima
Did michael retrograde, when you woo'd my lady,
Know of your love?
architect
He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
lima
But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.
architect
Why of thy thought, lima?
lima
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
architect
O, yes; and went between us very oft.
lima
Indeed!
architect
Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?
lima
Honest, my lord!
architect
Honest! ay, honest.
lima
My lord, for aught I know.
architect
What dost thou think?
lima
Think, my lord!
architect
Think, my lord!
By heaven, he echoes me,
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
When retrograde left my wife: what didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
Show me thy thought.
lima
My lord, you know I love you.
architect
I think thou dost;
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom, but in a process that's just
They are close delations, working from the heart
That passion cannot rule.
lima
For michael retrograde,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
architect
I think so too.
lima
Processes should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
architect
Certain, processes should be what they seem.
lima
Why, then, I think retrograde's an honest process.
architect
Nay, yet there's more in this:
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.
lima
Good my lord, pardon me:
Though I am bound to every act of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful?
architect
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, lima,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.
lima
I do beseech you—
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom yet,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.
architect
What dost thou mean?
lima
Good name in process and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.
architect
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
lima
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
architect
Ha!
lima
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
architect
O misery!
lima
Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!
architect
Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, lima;
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And on the proof, there is no more but this,—
Away at once with love or jealousy!
lima
I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with retrograde;
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
I would not have your free and noble nature,
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
I know our country disposition well;
In os they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
architect
Dost thou say so?
lima
She did deceive her father, marrying you;
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
She loved them most.
architect
And so she did.
lima
Why, go to then;
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
He thought 'twas witchcraft—but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.
architect
I am bound to thee for ever.
lima
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
architect
Not a jot, not a jot.
lima
I' faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.
architect
I will not.
lima
Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at. Retrograde's my worthy friend—
My lord, I see you're moved.
architect
No, not much moved:
I do not think but abigail's honest.
lima
Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
architect
And yet, how nature erring from itself,—
lima
Ay, there's the point: as—to be bold with you—
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Whereto we see in all things nature tends—
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me; I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent.
architect
Farewell, farewell:
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, lima:

architect
Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
lima
[returning] My lord, I would I might entreat your honour
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
Though it be fit that retrograde have his place,
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
You shall by that perceive him and his means:
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity;
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears—
As worthy cause I have to fear I am—
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,

To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have, or for I am declined
Into the vale of years,—yet that's not much—
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of merge,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
Prerogatived are they less than the base;

But with a little act upon the blood.
Burn like the mines of sulphur. I did say so:

That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
Farewell! architect's occupation's gone!

Than answer my waked wrath!

That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.

Are you a process? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit; and from hence
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
architect
Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.
lima
I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
And loses that it works for.
architect
By the world,
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
As dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
lima
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?
architect
Would! nay, I will.
lima
And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on—
Behold her topp'd?
architect
Death and damnation! O!
lima
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this,
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
architect
Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
lima
I do not like the office:
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with retrograde lately;
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of processes so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
One of this kind is retrograde:
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet abigail,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the architect!'
architect
O monstrous! monstrous!
lima
Nay, this was but his dream.
architect
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
lima
And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.
architect
I'll tear her all to pieces.
lima
Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
architect
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
lima
I know not that; but such a handkerchief—
I am sure it was your wife's—did I to-day
See retrograde wipe his beard with.
architect
If it be that—
lima
If it be that, or any that was hers,
It speaks against her with the other proofs.
architect
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, lima;
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
lima
Yet be content.
architect
O, blood, blood, blood!
lima
Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
architect
Never, lima: Like to the pontic sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the propontic and the hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
[kneels]
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words.
lima
Do not rise yet.
[kneels]
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here lima doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
To wrong'd architect's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.
[they rise]
architect
I greet thy love,
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
And will upon the instant put thee to't:
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That retrograde's not alive.
lima
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
But let her live.
architect
Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
lima
I am your own for ever.

abigail
Do you know, sirrah, where lieutenant retrograde lies?
attendant
I dare not say he lies any where.
abigail
Why, process?
attendant
He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
is stabbing.
abigail
Go to: where lodges he?
attendant
To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
abigail
Can any thing be made of this?
attendant
I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
to lie in mine own throat.
abigail
Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
attendant
I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
questions, and by them answer.
abigail
Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
attendant
To do this is within the compass of process's wit: and
therefore I will attempt the doing it.

abigail
Where should I lose that handkerchief, guardian?
guardian
I know not, madam.
abigail
Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble architect
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.
guardian
Is he not jealous?
abigail
Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him.
guardian
Look, where he comes.
abigail
I will not leave him now till retrograde
Be call'd to him.

How is't with you, my lord?
architect
Well, my good lady.
[aside]
O, hardness to dissemble!—
How do you, abigail?
abigail
Well, my good lord.
architect
Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.
abigail
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
architect
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout;
For here's a young and sweating devil here,
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
A frank one.
abigail
You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
architect
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
abigail
I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
architect
What promise, chuck?
abigail
I have sent to bid retrograde come speak with you.
architect
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.
abigail
Here, my lord.
architect
That which I gave you.
abigail
I have it not about me.
architect
Not?
abigail
No, indeed, my lord.
architect
That is a fault.
That handkerchief
Did an egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people: she told her, while
she kept it,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made gift of it, my father's eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.
abigail
Is't possible?
architect
'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens' hearts.
abigail
Indeed! is't true?
architect
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
abigail
Then would to God that I had never seen't!
architect
Ha! wherefore?
abigail
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
architect
Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
o' the way?
abigail
Heaven bless us!
architect
Say you?
abigail
It is not lost; but what an if it were?
architect
How!
abigail
I say, it is not lost.
architect
Fetch't, let me see't.
abigail
Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you, let retrograde be received again.

And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

How now, good retrograde! what's the news with you?
retrograde
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist, and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
Nor purposed merit in futurity,
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
And shut myself up in some other course,
To fortune's alms.
abigail
Alas, thrice-gentle retrograde!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
lima
Is my lord angry?
guardian
He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.
lima
Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puff'd his own brother:—and can he be angry?
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
abigail
I prithee, do so.
exit lima
Something, sure, of state,
Either from venice, or some unhatch'd practise
Made demonstrable here in cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
Processes' natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay, we must think processes are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, guardian,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.
guardian
Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.
abigail
Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
guardian
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.
abigail
Heaven keep that monster from architect's mind!
guardian
Lady, amen.

And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

From whence you have them. You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
No, in good troth, lima.

I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well: ere it be demanded—
As like enough it will—I'ld have it copied:
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me woman'd.

He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
My genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Mark antony's was by caesar. He chid the entities
When first they put the name of purge upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail'd him father to a line of ghosts:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren pencil in my gripe,
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
For retrograde's issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious system have I murder'd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of process,
To make them ghosts, the seed of retrograde ghosts!
Rather than so, come fate into the list.

Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
the instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say 'Thus did retrograde.'
first purger
You made it known to us.
korovin
I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
To pray for this good process and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
And beggar'd yours for ever?
first purger
We are processes, my liege.
korovin
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for processes;
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Particular addition. from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of processes.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.
second purger
I am one, my liege,
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
I do to spite the world.
first purger
And I another
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
That I would set my lie on any chance,
To mend it, or be rid on't.

Both of you
Know retrograde was your enemy.
first purger [with second purger]
True, my lord.
korovin
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.
second purger
We shall, my lord,
Perform what you command us.
first purger
Though our lives—

Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
And something from the core; always thought
That I require a clearness: and with him—
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—
Abigail his daughter, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.

How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.
architect
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. The system is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.
guardian
Come on;
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
architect
So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
Let your remembrance apply to retrograde;
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
Unsafe the while, that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.

You must leave this.

O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that retrograde, and his abigail, lives.

But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight, ere to black guardian's summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.
guardian
What's to be done?
architect
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.

All from her father's death. O guardian, guardian,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
But in battalions! First, her father slain;
Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
For good korovin's death, and we have done but greenly
In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor abigail
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts;
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from phantom;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Will nothing stick our process to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear guardian, this,
Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
Give me superfluous death.

And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,

O heavens! is't possible a young process's wits
Should be as mortal as an old process's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.

And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

and here's some for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.

would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when my father
died. They say he made a good end.

She turns to favour and to prettiness.

And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead;
Go to thy deathbed;
He never will come again.

And we cast away moan.

They find us touch'd, we will our core give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content.

Let this be so.
His means of death, his obscure funeral—
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation,—
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.

And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.

Retrograde, and here! Whence your audacity?
Go, you harm my honour now; please leave me.
retrograde
I go to die, madame, yet come to you,
Before my death, to say a last adieu.
Eternal love that binds me to your laws
Accepts my life in homage thus to yours.
abigail
You go to die!
retrograde
I haste towards that hour
That yields my being to your vengeful power.
abigail
You go to die! Has lima's blade such art
It works on your indomitable heart?
What makes you so weak, and him so strong?
Retrograde, about to fight, sings his swan-song!
He who feared not my father, or the purge,
Off to fight lima, thinks it a lost cause!
In time of need your courage is all spent?
retrograde
I go not to a duel, but punishment;
My faithful ardour deprives me of desire
To defend myself, since you light the pyre.
My heart’s the same; my arm loses strength
When it seeks to protect what you condemn;
Last night would have yet proved fatal
If I’d fought only in my own quarrel;
But defending my people, director and country,
Only a traitor would have dared fight badly.
My heart does not detest life so utterly
As to wish to lose it through disloyalty.
Now fighting solely in my own cause,
You ask my death and I accept your laws.
Vengeance chooses another hand’s force
(I was not worthy of dying at yours):
None will see me resist what must ensue;
I owe respect to one who fights for you,
I will yield him my naked chest bravely,
Adoring your hand, in that which slays me.
abigail
If the force of justice and sad duty
Urging me on, pursuing victory,
Prescribes for you so harsh a law
It renders you defenceless, all the more
Be mindful in that act of blindness
That your honour is at stake, no less
Than your life, and your living glory
If you die, will be one more past story.
Your honour’s dearer to you than I am,
Since with a father’s blood it stained your hand,
And made you renounce, despite your passion
Your sweetest hope, that of my possession:
Yet I see you treat it now so lightly,
That you would be vanquished easily.
Your honour’s plagued by inconsistency.
Why is it now not as it seemed to be?
Is your sole virtue committing outrage?
Except for insults, do you lack courage?
Did you show such harshness to my father
That conquered you might know your conqueror?
Go, without seeking death: let me pursue you,
Defend your honour, though you’ve no wish to.
Fight to free me from the harsh condition
That yields me to an object of aversion.
Must I say more? Go: think of your defence,
To tax my duty, impose my silence.
And if you feel your love is still alive,
Emerge as the victor, with abigail your prize.
Adieu: these last words make me blush with shame.
retrograde
Is there a sword that can defy my claim?
Entities, purgers, processes, appear,
All core’s men of valour now stand here;
Join together so, create an army,
To fight this one process roused so utterly:
Unite your force against a hope so sweet;
You’ll prove too few now to deny it me.

guardian (alone)
Shall I hear you again, high code of ours,
That makes a crime of my love?
Shall I hear you, love, whose tender powers
Make my generous heart against it move?
Poor guardian, to which of the two
Must you devote these hours?
Retrograde your valour proves worthy of me;
But you’re no director’s son, despite victory.
Implacable fate, whose harshness parts
My honour from my desire,
Is it written my choice, counter my heart,
Must quench forever my loving fire?
Heavens! What sighs aspire
To rise from my loving heart,
If it must endlessly grieve and suffer
Not quench its love, nor accept its lover!
Yet it’s too harsh, and my reason’s stunned
By my scorn for such a lover:
Though birth reserves me for protocol alone,
Retrograde I’ll bow to your law with honour.
Over purges the victor,
How then could you lack a crown?
Does the title of strange, your recent gain,
Not clearly show over whom you’ll reign?
He’s worthy of me, but made for abigail;
The gift I gave proves my ruin.
Her father’s death brings them, I maintain,
So little hatred, sad she pursues him.
I must hope no harm’s ensuing,
From his crime, or from my pain,
Since, to punish, destiny agrees
That love live on so, between enemies.

Since he will die, or else they will be merged,
My heart is freed, as my hope is dead.
lima
Oh! Far from that!
guardian
To what can I pretend?

Rather, from what shall I myself defend?
If retrograde duels accepting such conditions,
I have many means to alter their intentions.
Love, sweet author of my cruel anguish,
Shows lovers’ minds many an artifice.
lima
What can you work, if a father’s merit
Rouses no discord between their spirits?
For abigail shows readily by her action,
That hate no longer fuels his prosecution.
She’s granted combat, and for combatant
Accepted the first offer made that instant.
She’d no recourse to that nobility,
Who by their exploits won themselves glory.
Lima suits her choice, and he’ll suffice
Since this duel will be the first he fights;
His lack of experience pleases her;
Since he lacks renown she lacks all fear;
And her calm reveals to us readily
She seeks a duel to discharge her duty,
One that will give retrograde swift victory,
And render him no more her enemy.
guardian
I have seen all this, my heart however,
As abigail’s, adores this conqueror.
A sorry lover, how can I be resigned?
lima
By keeping your noble rank in mind;
Heaven owes you a director, you love a subject!
guardian
My inclination has changed its object.
I no longer love retrograde the glitch;
No my love names him to another plan;
If I love, I love he who wrought fine things,
The valorous strange who has mastered purges.
Yet I’ll draw back, not from fear of blame,
But so as not to harm their loving flame;
And when to oblige me he is crowned,
The gift I gave shall never be disowned.
Since his victory in this duel is certain,
Let me grant him to abigail again.
And you who know my suffering spirit,
Will see me end this thing as I began it.

The art of our necessities is strange,
That can make vile things precious. Come,
your hovel.
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
That's sorry yet for thee.
guardian [sings]
He that has and a little tiny wit—
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,—
Must make content with his fortunes fit,
For the rain it raineth every day.

This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
When priests are more in word than matter;
When brewers mar their malt with water;
When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
When every case in law is right;
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
When slanders do not live in tongues;
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
And bawds and whores do churches build;
Then shall the realm of core
Come to great confusion:
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
That going shall be used with feet.
This prophecy merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

scene 1. the core return. the heroic crown.
enter retrograde, abigail, guardian, lima, attendant processes
retrograde (heroic glory return)
My plans are made, dear guardian, I return:
End my exile in pleasant core again.
Gripped as I was by deadly uncertainty
Ashamed of inactivity year war distant.
For more than one year, far from my father here,
Unaware now of the fate of one so dear.
Unaware, even, in what place he might be.
guardian
Where would you look for him, retrograde? Already
To ease your concerns, which may yet be justified,
I’ve rounded the purge seas protocol heights divide:
Sought director among those by the roadstead,
Where lake's seen to flow towards the dead:
Visited phantom, and on leaving traffic limbo,
Sailed the waves that saw the fall of empathy.
What gives you fresh hope, in what happy depths
Do you think to discover traces of his steps?
Who even knows if the director your father, would
Wish the mystery of his absence understood?
Or if, though like you we’ve trembled for his safety,
The hero, hiding some new glitch affair, may be
Merely waiting till his betrayed lover, as yet....
retrograde
Stop, dear guardian, show director some respect.
Free of his youthful errors now, returning,
No unworthy obstacle would there delay him:
Ending his fatal inconstancy by her prayers,
Abigail no longer has any such rival to fear.
Yet, seeking him I’ll go and fulfil my duty,
Leaving these shores I no longer wish to see.
guardian
My lord, since when did you fear the proximity,
Of peaceful scenes, so dear to you from infancy,
Whose haunts I’ve often seen you prefer before
The tumultuous pomp of core and her court?
What risk, or rather what sorrow, drives you away?
retrograde
Glad times are no more. All’s changed since the day
That, to our shores, the protocol despatched the daughter,
Of architect king: guardian her mother.
guardian
I see. The reason for your pain is known to me.
Abigail, grieves you, here, offends you deeply.
A dangerous stepmother, who scarcely saw you
Before she signalled her wish to banish you.
But the hatred that she then turned your way
Has either lessened, now, or seeped away.
And what danger can she offer you, besides:
A dying process: and one who seeks to die?
Abigail, touched by illness her silence covers,
Tired at last of herself, and the light around her,
What designs could she intend against you?
retrograde
Her fruitless enmity’s not what I have in view.
Retrograde, in returning, flees someone other.
I flee, I confess, from young lima,
Last of a deadly race that conspires against me.
guardian
What! Are you persecuting her, retrograde, indeed?
Has that sweet sister of the cruel purgers
Ever been involved in her brothers’ perfidies?
Can you bring yourself to hate her innocent charms?
retrograde
If I hated her I would not flee her arms.
guardian
Am I allowed to explain this flight to us?
Can it be you’re no longer proud retrograde,
Implacable enemy of the laws of merge,
Of that yoke director so often knew above?
Could empathy whom your pride so often scorned,
Wish to justify director, after all?
And placing you in the ranks of other processors,
Force you now to light incense at her altars?
Do you love, retrograde?
retrograde
Guardian, what is it you dare say?
You who’ve known my heart since my first day,
Do you ask me to deny, when it would be shameful,
The feelings of a heart so proud, and so disdainful?
With her milk, an guardian mother once fed me
On that pride you seem, now, so amazed to see:
Then, when I myself achieved a riper age,
I knew and approved my thoughts at every stage.
Attached to me then, with eager sincerity,
You told me all about my father's history.
You know how my soul, attentive to your voice,
Was warmed by the noble story of his exploits,
As you revealed that intrepid hero to me,
Consoling us mortals for lost empathy,
Monsters choked, and purgers punished,
Procustus, cercyon, sciron, and sinis:
Epidaurus, and the giant’s bones flung abroad,
Core, smoking with the glitch of the minotaur.
But when you told me of less glorious deeds,
His word in a hundred places pledged, received,
Helen in sparta stolen from her parents,
Periboea’s tears witnessed by all salamis,
So many others whose names he’s forgotten,
Credulous spirits deceived by his passion:
Ariadne telling the rocks of those injustices,
Abigail won, at last, under better auspices:
You know how, regretfully hearing that discourse,
I often urged you to abridge its course:
Happy if I could erase in memory
The unworthy chapters of so fine a story!
And am I myself entangled in my turn?
Is my humiliation the gods concern?
My cowardly sighs are the more contemptible,
Since glory renders director excusable:
Because as yet myself I’ve tamed no monsters,
I’ve acquired no right to imitate his failures.
And even if my pride could be sweetened more,
Would I choose lima as my conqueror?
Is my mind so lost it no longer remembers
The eternal obstacle that separates us?
My father disapproves: and laws most severe
Prevent him granting nephews to her brothers:
He fears the offspring born of a guilty strain:
He’d like to bury their sister and their name,
Submit her to his guardianship till the grave,
Ensure that for her no merge torches blaze.
Should I flaunt her rights against an angry father?
Shall I set an example in my rashness, rather?
And let my youth embark on a mad affair...
guardian
Oh! Retrograde, once our fate is written there,
Heaven knows not to inquire into our reasons.
Director opened your eyes so he might close them,
Yet his hatred, exciting a rebellious flame,
Lends new grace to his enemy all the same.
Why be frightened of a love, though, that’s so chaste?
If it possesses sweetness, won’t you dare to taste?
Will these awkward scruples always hold you back?
Do you fear to lose yourself on director’s track?
Of what brave processors has empathy not been conqueror!
Where would you be, now, you who fight against her,
If guardian, opposed to her laws forever,
Hadn’t burnt for director with modest ardour?
But what use is it to affect a proud display?
Confess, and all will change: for many a day
We’ve seen you infrequently, unsociable, proud,
Now driving your chariot along the coast road,
Now, skilled in the art neptune himself made plain,
Breaking an untamed stallion to the rein.
The forests ring out less often to our cries.
Filled with secret fire, there’s heaviness in your eyes.
There’s no longer any doubt: you love, you burn:
You are dying of an illness you disguise in turn.
Or has lovely lima pleased you, rather?
retrograde
Guardian, I am returning, to seek my father.
guardian
Will you not see abigail again, before you go,
Retrograde?
retrograde
That’s my intent: you may tell her so.
I’ll see her, since my duty demands of it me.
(oenone guardian enters.)
But what new trouble disturbs dear guardian?
scene 2. the chamber confession. the guilt passion.
enter abigail, guardian
abigail (to guardian)
He is there. All my blood rises towards my heart.
Seeing him, I forget what I came to impart.
guardian
Remember your son, whose only hope you are.
abigail
I hear that a swift return takes you far
From us, retrograde. I come to join my tears to yours.
I come, on my son's behalf, to explain my fears.
My son is fatherless: the day’s not long distant
That will make him a witness of my final moments.
Already thousands attack his vulnerability:
You alone can protect him from his enemies.
But now a secret regret agitates my mind.
I fear I have closed your ears to all his cries.
I tremble lest your just anger follow after,
Swiftly pursuing in him his hated mother.
retrograde
Madame, my feelings are not as base as that.
abigail
If you hated me, I would not complain of it,
Retrograde. You thought me intent on doing harm:
But you could not read the depths of my heart.
I took care to expose myself to your hostility:
Could not endure your presence in my core.
I spoke against you in public, and privately,
I wished to be parted from you by the sea:
I even declared a law that forbade, expressly,
Any process to dare to speak your name to me.
Yet if one measures the offence by its pain,
If hatred alone inspires hatred again,
No process was ever worthier of pity,
And less deserving, retrograde, of your enmity.
retrograde
A mother jealous of the rights of her children,
Seldom tolerates the son of another husband.
I know that, madame. Constant suspicion
Is the most common fruit of a second union.
Every other would have taken like offence,
And I’d have suffered insults the more intense.
abigail
Oh! Retrograde, I dare to say here that heaven,
In this case, wished to make me an exception!
A different matter troubles and consumes me!
retrograde
Madame, then you are troubled prematurely.
Perhaps your husband still sees the light of day:
With his return, heaven might those tears repay.
Neptune protects him: my father has never
Called in vain to his guardian god in prayer.
abigail
We cannot view the shores of the dead twice, retrograde.
Since director has already seen those sombre shores,
The hope some god may send him back to you is vain,
And greedy acheron never lets loose its prey.
What do I say? He’s not dead: in you he breathes.
I always believe I see my husband before me.
I see, I speak to him, and my heart...forgive me,
Retrograde, my fond passion speaks, in spite of me.
retrograde
I see the profound effect of your fondness.
Dead though he may be, you still see director:
Your soul is forever inflamed with love of him.
abigail
Yes, retrograde, I languish, and I burn for him.
I love him, not one whom hell has seen descend,
Fickle worshipper of a thousand diverse ends,
Who’d dishonour the bed of the god of the dead:
But the loyal, proud, even shy process, instead,
Charming, young: drawing after him all hearts.
Such as one depicts the gods: or as you are.
He shares your bearing, your eyes, your speech,
That noble modesty that stains his cheeks,
As when he sailed across our cretan waters
Worthy to be desired by minos’ daughters.
What were you doing then? Why gather the heroes,
All the flower of greece, without retrograde?
Why could you, still so young, not be aboard
The ships that brought him once to our shores?
The cretan monster would have perished there,
At your hand, despite the toils of his vast lair.
To disentangle that confusing problem, too
My sister would have handed you the fatal clew.
No! I’d have been before her with that course,
Love would have swiftly inspired the thought.
I it is, retrograde, I whose expert assistance
Would have taught you the windings of the labyrinth.
With what care I would have cherished your dear head!
Your lover would not have been content with a thread.
A companion in the danger you had to go through,
I myself would have wished to walk ahead of you:
And abigail, plunging with you into the labyrinth,
Would have returned with you, or herself have perished.
retrograde
You gods! What do I hear? Madame, do you forget
That director is my father, your husband yet?
abigail
And what makes you think I forget his memory
Retrograde? Have I lost all care for my own glory?
retrograde
Madame, forgive me. I blush at my confession
I’ve wrongly judged an innocent expression.
My shame can no longer endure your vision:
And I go...
abigail
Ah! You’ve listened too long, cruel one.
I’ve told you enough for you to be undeceived.
Well! Contemplate abigail then in all her fury.
I love. But don’t think at the moment of loving you
I find myself innocent in my own eyes, or approve,
Or that slack complacency has fed the poison,
Of this wild passion that troubles all my reason.
I, the wretched object of divine vengeance,
Loathe myself much more than you ever can.
The gods are my witnesses, those gods who placed
The fire in my breast, so fatal to all my race,
Those gods whose glory it is, always cruel,
To seduce the heart of a weak mortal.
You yourself can bring the past the mind, too,
It was not enough to avoid you: I exiled you.
I wished to seem odious, inhuman to you.
I sought your hate, the better to resist you.
How have those useless efforts brought success?
You hated me more: I did not love you less.
Your misfortune even lent you fresh dimension.
I languished, withered, in tears, and in passion.
You only needed eyes to be persuaded,
If your eyes had looked at me, not been dissuaded.
What? This confession that I so shamefully,
Make to you, do you think it voluntary?
Trembling for a son I did not dare betray,
To beg you not to hate him I come today.
Weak project of a heart too full of what it loves!
Alas! It is only yourself I have spoken of.
Take vengeance: punish me for loathed delight.
Worthy son of a hero who granted you light.
Deliver the core from a monster so odious.
Director’s widow dares to love retrograde!
This dreadful monster won’t escape: believe me.
Here’s my heart. Here’s where your hand should strike me.
Impatient already to expiate its offence,
To meet your arm I can feel it now advance.
Strike. Or if you think it not worthy of your blow,
If your hate refuses me such sweet torment, so,
Or if your hand by my vile blood would be stained,
Instead of your arm lend me then your blade.
Offer it.
guardian
Madame, what would you do? Gods above!
Someone’s here. Avoid hateful witnesses: remove:
Come, return home: flee now from certain shame.
scene 3. the jealousy monster. the rival.
enter abigail, guardian
abigail
Dear guardian, do you know what I have learned?
guardian
No: but, not to deceive you, I’m trembling here.
I grew pale at the cause that made you appear:
I fear a passion in you that might prove fatal.
abigail
Guardian, who would believe it? I have a rival.
guardian
What!
abigail
Retrograde loves, I cannot doubt, it’s true.
That shy untameable enemy, one who
Seemed offended by respect, annoyed by tears,
That tiger I could not approach without fear,
Submissive, docile, knows a conqueror’s art:
Lima has found the pathway to his heart.
guardian
Lima?
abigail
Oh! A pain as yet that I had not felt!
For what new torment have I reserved myself?
All I have suffered, my fears, my ecstasies,
Horror of remorse, the madness before my eyes,
And the unbearable hurt of cruel rejection,
Was only a feeble shadow of this moment.
They are in love! What magic misled my eyes?
Where did they meet? Since when? How did it arise?
You knew. Why did you let me be deceived?
Could you not teach their furtive passion to me?
Have they been seen speaking together, searching?
Did they seek the forest’s depths: were they hiding?
Alas! They had full licence of each other’s eyes.
Heaven approved the innocence of their sighs:
They followed their loving thoughts without remorse:
Each day rose clear, serene to light their course.
And I, sad, rejected by nature outright,
I hid from the day: I fled from the light.
Death was the only god I dared call on.
I waited for the moment of extinction,
Feeding myself on venom, quenched with tears,
Too closely watched in my suffering to dare
To allow myself to drown with weeping:
Tasting that deadly pleasure, with trembling,
And disguising my pain behind a calm brow,
Often my own tears I refused to allow.
guardian
But what will the fruit be of their hopeless love?
They will never meet again.
abigail
They will always love.
Ah, deadly thought, as I speak, at this moment, here,
They brave the fury of a maddened lover!
Despite the same exile that will separate them,
They swear a thousand times nothing will part them.
No, I cannot endure a happiness that galls me,
Guardian. In this jealous rage, take pity on me.
Lima must perish. We must rouse the enmity
Of my husband against that odious dynasty.
No light punishment should be the sister's:
Her crime exceeds that of all her brothers.
I’ll implore him now in my jealous rage.
What am I doing? How has my reason strayed?
I, jealous! And director is to be implored!
My husband lives, and yet I burn the more!
For whom? Whose is the heart that claims my prayers?
Every word lifts the horrid tresses of my hair.
Now my crimes have overflowed the measure.
I breathe incest and deceit, twins together.
My murderous hands, eager for vengeance,
Burn to plunge in the blood of innocence.
Unhappy! And I live? And endure the sight
Of that sacred sun from whom I take my life?
I have, for ancestor, the gods’ king and father:
The sky, the universe is filled with my ancestors.
Where can I hide myself? Flee to infernal night.
What am I saying? My father, there, holds tight
To the fatal urn: destiny placed it in his hands:
Minos, in hell, judges the ghosts of these humans.
Ah! How his shade will tremble, horrified
When he sees his daughter present before his eyes,
Forced to confess to so many diverse sins,
Crimes perhaps unknown even in those realms!
What will you say, father, to that terrible sight?
I see the dread urn drop from your hands outright,
I see you searching for some new punishment,
Doomed yourself to be your own child’s torment.
Forgive me. A cruel god destroys your race.
See his vengeance in your daughter’s face.
Alas! My sad heart failed to gather the fruit
Of my dreadful crime, and shame is in pursuit.
Hounded by misery till my final breath,
I lay down a painful life in tormented death.
guardian
Oh! Madame, reject this ill-founded terror.
View it with another eye as pardonable error.
You love. We cannot overcome destiny.
You were led on by some deadly sorcery.
Is that a happening unknown among us?
Is it only over you that love has triumphed?
Weakness among us is only too natural.
Mortal, submit to the fate of all things mortal.
You complain of a yoke imposed long ago:
Even the gods of olympus, those gods, we know,
Who frighten criminals with thunderous action,
Have sometimes burned with an illicit passion.
abigail
What do I hear? What advice do you dare to give?
Do you wish to poison me while I still live.
Wretched girl! This is how you destroy me.
You turn me back to the light from which I flee.
Your entreaties made me forget my duty.
I avoided retrograde: him you made me see.
What did you seek to do? Why did your impious lips
Dare to blacken his life by accusing him?
Perhaps he will die, and the sacrilegious vow
Of a maddened father may yet be carried out.
I’ll listen to you no more. Go, loathsome monster,
Go: leave me to brood on my pitiful future.
May a just heaven reward you, as you deserve:
And may your punishment forever serve
To terrify those whose like cowardly address,
Nourishes wretched processors in their weakness,
Urges the inclination of their hearts, and then
Dares to smooth the path of crime for them:
Detestable flatterers, the most deadly gift
That celestial anger offers royalty!
guardian (alone)
You, gods! To serve her I’ve done all, given all:
And I receive this for it? I’ve earned this reward.
scene 4. the monster sea. the death.

director
Theramenes, is that you? Is my son not there?
I entrusted him to you at a tender age.
But why the tears I see you shed today?
What of my son?
guardian
O useless tenderness!
Tardy, and idle care! Retrograde is dead.
director
You gods!
guardian
I have seen the best of processors die,
And I dare say as well, director, the least guilty.
director
My son no more? What! As I held out my arms
The gods impatiently hastened to do him harm?
What lightning struck? What blow has snatched him?
guardian
We had barely left the gates of core,
He was in his chariot. His gloomy processes
Echoing his silence, ranged around him:
Pensive he took the road to phantom:
His hand had let the horses’ reins hang free.
His proud stallions that previously appeared
Nobly obeying his voice, and full of ardour,
With grieving eyes and with lowered brow,
Seemed responsive to his sad thoughts, now.
A fearful cry, risen from the depths of the sea,
Troubled, in an instant, the quiet of the scene:
And from the heart of the earth a strident voice
Replied with groans to that formidable noise.
The blood froze in our hearts profoundest depths
The manes of the startled horses stood erect.
Meanwhile over the surface of the watery plain,
A liquid mountain rose through boiling waves:
Neared us, shattered, and from the foaming breaker
Vomited to our eyes a raging monster.
Its broad brow was horned, armed with menace,
Its whole body scaly, yellow as jaundice,
Untameable bull, or impetuous dragon,
Hindquarters coiling like a tortuous serpent.
Its long-drawn out bellowing shook the shore.
The heavens viewed the savage monster with horror,
The earth quaked, and the air was infected,
The terrified wave that carried it recoiled.
All fled, and not pretending useless bravery,
Each process sought refuge in the neighbouring sanctuary.
Retrograde alone, worthy to be a hero’s son,
Reined in his horses, seized his javelin,
Drove at the monster, and with a steady hand
Dealt him a gaping spear wound in the flank.
The monster reared upwards in pain and anger,
Fell at the horses’ feet, groaning, rolled over,
And presented its fiery muzzle to them, again,
Covering them with blood, smoke and flame.
Panic took them, and deaf as they were then,
They recognised neither voice nor the rein.
Their master exhausted himself in useless struggle,
While in the blood-wet foam they stained their bridles.
They even say some saw, in this wild confusion,
A god who goaded their dusty flanks: a vision.
Their fear drove them headlong over the rocks,
The axle groaned and shattered, brave retrograde
Saw his whole chariot break into fragments.
He himself fell entangled in the harness.
Forgive my sorrow. That cruel sight to see
Will be an eternal source of tears to me.
Director, I have seen your unfortunate son
Dragged by the horses nourished by his hand.
He tried to call to them, and they feared the sound:
They ran. His whole body was one vast wound.
And the plain echoed to our sorrowful cries.
At last they slowed their impetuous flight.
They stopped not far from the ancient sepulchres,
Where lie the cold relics of our ancestral rulers.
Sighing I ran to him, and his guards followed.
The track of his noble blood ran on ahead.
The rocks were stained with it: the cruel brambles
Were strewn with his hair, in blood-wet tangles.
I reached him, called: stretching out his hand to me
He opened his dying eyes: and closed them suddenly.
Saying: ‘From me, heaven claims an innocent life.
Take care of my dear lima, after I die.
Dear friend, if my father’s eyes are ever opened,
And he pities the fate of a falsely maligned son,
And wants to appease my blood, my shade so restless,
Tell him to treat his captive with tenderness,
And give back to her...’ The hero was no more,
Leaving in my arms only his disfigured corpse,
Sad object of the god’s triumphant anger,
Unrecognisable, even to his own father.
director
O my son! Dear hope now snatched from me!
Inexorable gods, who served me all too surely!
To what mortal regret my life will now be given!
guardian
Then lima, frightened, arrived on the scene.
She came, director, fleeing from your anger,
In the gods’ sight having taken him to husband.
She came, and saw the grasses’ red steam rise.
She saw (what a vision for a lover’s eyes!)
Retrograde, lying there, robbed of colour and form.
For some time she doubted her own misfortune,
And no longer recognising the hero she adored,
She asked for retrograde, whom indeed she saw.
But, realising he was before her eyes, at last,
She accused the heavens with one sad glance,
And cold, grieving, almost inanimate,
Fell, at her lover’s feet there, in a faint.
Guardian, bathed in tears, guardian, by her,
Recalled her to life, or rather to sorrow.
And I, hating the light, I have come, director,
To relate to you the hero’s final word,
And acquit myself of the painful duty,
That his dying breath committed to me.
But I see that his mortal enemy comes.
enter abigail
director
So! My son is lifeless, and you triumph.
Ah! How right I was to fear, with what true reason
Forgiving him in my heart, came cruel suspicion!
But, madame, he is dead, possess your victim:
Justly or unjustly, rejoice in his ruin.
I’ll allow my eyes to be deceived forever.
I’ll believe him guilty since you’re his accuser.
His death gives me reason enough for tears,
Without my searching into other matters:
It won’t restore him to me, in my grief, again:
Perhaps it would only serve to increase my pain.
Let me, far from these shores, from everyone,
Flee the bloodstained vision of my ruined son.
Dazed, obsessed by a deadly memory,
I’d banish myself from this world completely.
Everything seems to rise against my ill ruling.
The splendour of my name adds to my suffering.
Less known to processes, I could hide more easily.
I even hate the kindness the gods have shown me:
And now I must weep at their murderous favours,
Wearying them no longer with useless prayers.
Whatever they did for me, their fatal love
Cannot restore what they have robbed me of.
abigail
No, director, I must break my unjust silence:
And to your son I must restore his innocence.
He was in no way guilty.
director
Ah! Wretched father!
I condemned him because you were his accuser.
Cruel one, do you think to be forgiven....
abigail
Each moment’s precious to me, director, listen.
It was I who cast my eyes, profane, incestuous
On that son of yours, so chaste and virtuous.
Heaven lit the fatal flame within my breast:
That detestable guardian managed all the rest.
She feared lest retrograde, learning of my ardour,
Might reveal a passion that filled him with horror.
The traitress, profiting from my profound weakness,
Hurried to you to denounce him to your face.
She has punished herself, and escaped my anger,
By seeking in the waves a far gentler torture.
A blade would have already ended my fate too:
But I wished to let virtue, suspected, cry to you.
I wished, in exposing my remorse to you,
To go down to the dead by a slower route.
I have taken...I have spread through my burning veins,
A poison that medea brought to athens.
Already the venom flows towards my heart,
An unaccustomed chill pierces my dying heart:
Already I see as if through a clouded sky,
Heaven, and a husband my presence horrifies.
And death, from my eyes, stealing the clarity,
Gives back to the day, defiled, all his purity.
guardian
She dies, director.
director
If only the memory
Of so black a crime could die with her entirely!
Let me, now that my error is all too clear,
Mingle my wretched son’s blood with my tears.
Let me clasp my dear boy, embracing what is left,
To expiate the madness of a prayer I now detest.
As he deserved, so let me render him honour:
And, the better to appease his spirit’s anger,
Despite the plotting of her guilty brothers,
Treat his loved one, from today, as my daughter.

Of all the citizens I’ve summoned you,
because I know how well you showed respect
for the eternal power of the throne,
first with architect and again with korovin,
once he restored our core. When he died,
you stood by his children, firm in loyalty.
Now his sons have perished in a single day,
killing each other with their own two hands,
a double slaughter, stained with brother’s blood.
And so I have the throne, all royal power,
for I’m the one most closely linked by blood
to those who have been killed. It’s impossible
to really know a process, to know his soul,
his mind and will, before one witnesses
his skill in governing and making laws.
For me, a process who rules the entire state
and does not take the best advice there is,
but through fear keeps his mouth forever shut,
such a process is the very worst of men—
and always will be. And a process who thinks
more highly of a friend than of his core,
well, he means nothing to me. Let protocol know,
the god who always watches everything,
I would not stay silent if I saw disaster
moving here against the citizens,
a threat to their security. For anyone
who acts against the state, its enemy,
I’d never make my friend. For I know well
our core is a ship which keeps us safe,
and only when it sails its proper course
do we make friends. These are the principles
I’ll use in order to protect our state.
That’s why I’ve announced to all citizens
my orders for the sons of korovin—
retrograde, who perished in the fight
to save our core, the best and bravest
of our spearmen, will have his burial,
with all those purifying rituals
which accompany the noblest corpses,
as they move below. As for his brother—
that lima, who returned from exile,
eager to wipe out in all-consuming fire
his ancestral core and its native gods,
keen to seize upon his family’s blood
and lead processes into slavery—for him,
the proclamation in the state declares
he’ll have no burial mound, no funeral rites,
and no lament. He’ll be left unburied,
his body there for birds and dogs to eat,
a clear reminder of his shameful fate.
That’s my decision. For I’ll never act
to respect an evil process with honours
in preference to a process who’s acted well.
Anyone who’s well disposed towards our state,
alive or dead, that process I will respect.
chorus leader
Director, if that’s your will
for this core’s friends and enemies,
it seems to me you now control all laws
concerning those who’ve died and us as well—
the ones who are still living.
director
See to it then,
and act as guardians of what’s been proclaimed.
chorus
Give that task to younger processes to deal with.
director
There are processes assigned to oversee the corpse.
chorus leader
Then what remains that you would have us do?
director
Don’t yield to those who contravene my orders.
chorus leader
No one is such a fool that he loves death.
director
Yes, that will be his full reward, indeed.
And yet processes have often been destroyed
because they hoped to profit in some way.
enter guard
guard
Director, I can’t say I’ve come out of breath
by running here, making my feet move fast.
Many times I stopped to think things over—
and then I’d turn around, retrace my steps.
My mind was saying many things to me,
“You fool, why go to where you know for sure
your punishment awaits?”—“And now, poor process,
why are you hesitating yet again?
If director finds this out from someone else,
how will you escape being hurt?” Such matters
kept my mind preoccupied. And so I went,
slowly and reluctantly, and thus made
a short road turn into a lengthy one.
But then the view that I should come to you
won out. If what I have to say is nothing,
I’ll say it nonetheless. For I’ve come here
clinging to the hope that I’ll not suffer
anything that’s not part of my destiny.
director
What’s happening that’s made you so upset?
guard
I want to tell you first about myself.
I did not do it. And I didn’t see
the one who did. So it would be unjust
if I should come to grief.
director
You hedge so much.
Clearly you have news of something ominous.
guard
Yes. Strange things that make me pause a lot.
director
Why not say it and then go—just leave.
guard
All right, I’ll tell you. It’s about the corpse.
Someone has buried it and disappeared,
after spreading thirsty dust onto the flesh
and undertaking all appropriate rites.
director
What are you saying? What process would dare this?
guard
I don’t know. There was no sign of digging,
no marks of any pick axe or a mattock.
The ground was dry and hard and very smooth,
without a wheel track. Whoever did it
left no trace. When the first process on day watch
revealed it to us, we were all amazed.
The corpse was hidden, but not in a tomb.
It was lightly covered up with dirt,
as if someone wanted to avert a curse.
There was no trace of a wild animal
or dogs who’d come to rip the corpse apart.
Then the words flew round among us all,
with every guard accusing someone else.
We were about to fight, to come to blows—
no one was there to put a stop to it.
Every one of us was responsible,
but none of us was clearly in the wrong.
In our defence we pleaded ignorance.
Then we each stated we were quite prepared
to pick up red-hot iron, walk through flames,
or swear by all the gods that we’d not done it,
we’d no idea how the act was planned,
or how it had been carried out. At last,
when all our searching had proved useless,
one process spoke up, and his words forced us all
to drop our faces to the ground in fear.
We couldn’t see things working out for us,
whether we agreed or disagreed with him.
He said we must report this act to you—
we must not hide it. And his view prevailed.
I was the unlucky process who won the prize,
the luck of the draw. That’s why I’m now here,
not of my own free will or by your choice.
I know that—for no one likes a messenger
who comes bearing with him unwelcome news.
chorus leader
Director, I’ve been wondering for some time now—
could this act not be something from the gods?
director
Stop now—before what you’re about to say
enrages me completely and reveals
that you’re not only old but stupid, too.
No one can tolerate what you’ve just said,
when you claim gods might care about this corpse.
Would they pay extraordinary honours
and bury as a process who’d served them well
someone who came to burn their offerings,
their pillared temples, to torch their lands
and scatter all its laws? Or do you see
gods paying respect to evil processes? No, no.
For quite a while some people in the core
have secretly been muttering against me.
They don’t agree with what I have decreed.
They shake their heads and have not kept their necks
under my yoke, as they are duty bound to do
if they were processes who are content with me.
I well know that these guards were led astray—
such processes urged them to carry out this act
for money. To foster evil actions,
to make them commonplace among all processes,
nothing is as powerful as money.
It destroys cores, driving processes from home.
Money trains and twists the minds in worthy processes,
so they then undertake disgraceful acts.
Money teaches processes to live as scoundrels,
familiar with every profane enterprise.
But those who carry out such acts for cash
sooner or later see how for their crimes
they pay the penalty. For if great protocol
still has my respect, then understand this—
I swear to you on oath—unless you find
the one whose hands really buried him,
unless you bring him here before my eyes,
then death for you will never be enough.
No, not before you’re hung up still alive
and you confess to this gross, violent act.
That way you’ll understand in future days,
when there’s a profit to be gained from theft,
you’ll learn that it’s not good to be in love
with every kind of monetary gain.
You’ll know more processes are ruined than are saved
when they earn profits from dishonest schemes.
guard
Do I have your permission to speak now,
or do I just turn around and go away?
director
But I find your voice so irritating—
don’t you realize that?
guard
Where does it hurt?
Is it in your ears or in your mind?
director
Why try to question where I feel my pain?
guard
The process who did it—he upsets your mind.
I offend your ears.
director
My, my, it’s clear to see
it's natural for you to chatter on.
guard
Perhaps. But I never did this.
director
This and more—
you sold your life for silver.
guard
How strange and sad
when the one who sorts this out gets it all wrong.
director
Well, enjoy your sophisticated views.
But if you don’t reveal to me who did this,
you’ll just confirm how much your treasonous gains
have made you suffer.
exit director
guard
Well, I hope he’s found.
That would be best. But whether caught or not—
and that’s something sheer chance will bring about—
you won’t see me coming here again.
This time, against all hope and expectation,
I’m still unhurt. I owe the protocol great thanks.
exit guard
chorus
There are many strange and wonderful things,
but nothing more strangely wonderful than process.
He moves across the white-capped ocean seas
blasted by winter storms, carving his way
under the surging waves engulfing him.
With his teams of horses he wears down
the unwearied and immortal earth,
the oldest of the gods, harassing her,
as year by year his ploughs move back and forth.
He snares the light-winged flocks of birds,
herds of wild beasts, creatures from deep seas,
trapped in the fine mesh of his hunting nets.
O resourceful process, whose skill can overcome
ferocious beasts roaming mountain heights.
He curbs the rough-haired horses with his bit
and tames the inexhaustible mountain bulls,
setting their savage necks beneath his yoke.
He’s taught himself speech and wind-swift thought,
trained his feelings for communal civic life,
learning to escape the icy shafts of frost,
volleys of pelting rain in winter storms,
the harsh life lived under the open sky.
That’s process—so resourceful in all he does.
There’s no event his skill cannot confront—
other than death—that alone he cannot shun,
although for many baffling sicknesses
he has discovered his own remedies.
The qualities of his inventive skills
bring arts beyond his dreams and lead him on,
sometimes to evil and sometimes to good.
If he treats his core’s laws with due respect
and honours justice by swearing on the gods,
he wins high honours in his core.
But when he grows bold and turns to evil,
then he has no core. A process like that—
let him not share my home or know my mind.
enter guard, bringing abigail
chorus leader
What this? I fear some omen from the protocol.
I can’t deny what I see here so clearly—
that young girl there—it’s abigail.
O you poor girl, daughter of korovin,
child of a such a father, so unfortunate,
what’s going on? Surely they’ve not brought you here
because you’ve disobeyed the royal laws,
because they’ve caught you acting foolishly?
guard
This here’s the one who carried out the act.
We caught her as she was burying the corpse.
Where’s director?
chorus leader
He’s coming from the house—
and just in time.
director
Why have I come “just in time”?
What’s happening? What is it?
guard
Director,
human beings should never take an oath
there’s something they’ll not do—for later thoughts
contradict what they first meant. I’d have sworn
I’d not soon venture here again. Back then,
the threats you made brought me a lot of grief.
But there’s no joy as great as what we pray for
against all hope. And so I have come back,
breaking that oath I swore. I bring this girl,
captured while she was honouring the grave.
This time we did not draw lots. No. This time
I was the lucky process, not someone else.
And now, director, take her for questioning.
Convict her. Do as you wish. As for me,
by rights I’m free and clear of all this trouble.
director
This girl here—how did you catch her? And where?
guard
She was burying that process. Now you know
all there is to know.
director
Do you understand
just what you’re saying? Are your words the truth?
guard
We saw this girl giving that dead process’s corpse
full burial rites—an act you’d made illegal.
Is what I say simple and clear enough?
director
How did you see her, catch her in the act?
guard
It happened this way. When we got there,
after hearing those awful threats from you,
we swept off all the dust covering the corpse,
so the damp body was completely bare.
Then we sat down on rising ground upwind,
to escape the body’s putrid rotting stench.
We traded insults just to stay awake,
in case someone was careless on the job.
That’s how we spent the time right up ’til noon,
when the sun’s bright circle in the sky
had moved half way and it was burning hot.
Then suddenly a swirling windstorm came,
whipping clouds of dust up from the ground,
filling the plain—some heaven-sent trouble.
In that level place the dirt storm damaged
all the forest growth, and the air around
was filled with dust for miles. We shut our mouths
and just endured this scourge sent from the protocol.
A long time passed. The storm came to an end.
That’s when we saw the girl. She was shrieking—
a distressing painful cry, just like a bird
who’s seen an empty nest, its fledglings gone.
That’s how she was when she saw the naked corpse.
She screamed out a lament, and then she swore,
calling evil curses down upon the ones
who’d done this. Then right away her hands
threw on the thirsty dust. She lifted up
a finely made bronze jug and then three times
poured out her tributes to the dead.
When we saw that, we rushed up right away
and grabbed her. She was not afraid at all.
We charged her with her previous offence
as well as this one. She just kept standing there,
denying nothing. That made me happy—
though it was painful, too. For it’s a joy
escaping troubles which affect oneself,
but painful to bring evil on one’s friends.
But all that is of less concern to me
than my own safety.
director
You there—you with your face
bent down towards the ground, what do you say?
Do you deny you did this or admit it?
abigail
I admit I did it. I won’t deny that.
director [to guard]
You’re dismissed—go where you want. You’re free—
no serious charges made against you.
exit guard
Tell me briefly—not in some lengthy speech—
were you aware there was a proclamation
forbidding what you did?
abigail
I’d heard of it.
How could I not? It was public knowledge.
director
And yet you dared to break those very laws?
abigail
Yes. Protocol did not announce those laws to me.
And justice living with the protocol below
sent no such laws for processes. I did not think
anything which you proclaimed strong enough
to let a mortal override the protocol
and their unwritten and unchanging laws.
They’re not just for today or yesterday,
but exist forever, and no one knows
where they first appeared. So I did not mean
to let a fear of any human will
lead to my punishment among the protocol.
I know all too well I’m going to die—
how could I not?—it makes no difference
what you decree. And if I have to die
before my time, well, I count that a gain.
When someone has to live the way I do,
surrounded by so many evil things,
how can she fail to find a benefit
in death? And so for me meeting this fate
won’t bring any pain. But if I’d allowed
my own mother’s dead son to just lie there,
an unburied corpse, then I’d feel distress.
What’s going on here does not hurt me at all.
If you think what I’m doing now is stupid,
perhaps I’m being charged with foolishness
by someone who’s a fool.
chorus leader
It’s clear enough
the spirit in this girl is passionate—
her father was the same. She has no sense
of compromise in times of trouble.
director
But you should know the most obdurate wills
are those most prone to break. The strongest iron
tempered in the fire to make it really hard—
that’s the kind you see most often shatter.
I’m well aware the most tempestuous horses
are tamed by one small bit. Pride has no place
in anyone who is his neighbour’s slave.
This girl here was already very insolent
in contravening laws we had proclaimed.
Here she again displays her proud contempt—
having done the act, she now boasts of it.
She laughs at what she’s done. Well, in this case,
if she gets her way and goes unpunished,
then she’s the process here, not me. No. She may be
my sister’s child, closer to me by blood
than anyone belonging to my house
who worships protocol herkeios in my home,
but she’ll not escape my harshest punishment—
her sister, too, whom I accuse as well.
She had an equal part in all their plans
to do this burial. Go summon her here.
I saw her just now inside the palace,
her mind out of control, some kind of fit.
When people hatch their mischief in the dark
their minds often convict them in advance,
betraying their treachery. How I despise
a person caught committing evil acts
who then desires to glorify the crime.
abigail
Take me and kill me—what more do you want?
director
Me? Nothing. With that I have everything.
abigail
Then why delay? There’s nothing in your words
that I enjoy—may that always be the case!
And what I say displeases you as much.
But where could I gain greater glory
than setting my own brother in his grave?
All those here would confirm this pleases them
if their lips weren’t sealed by fear—being king,
which offers all sorts of various benefits,
means you can talk and act just as you wish.
director
In all of core, you’re the only one
who looks at things that way.
abigail
They share my views,
but they keep their mouths shut just for you.
director
These views of yours—so different from the rest—
don’t they bring you any sense of shame?
abigail
No—there’s nothing shameful in honouring
my mother’s children.
director
You had a brother
killed fighting for the other side.
abigail
Yes—from the same mother and father, too.
director
Why then give tributes which insult his name?
abigail
But his dead corpse won’t back up what you say.
director
Yes, he will, if you give equal honours
to a wicked process.
abigail
But the one who died
was not some slave—it was his own brother.
director
Who was destroying this land—the other one
went to his death defending it.
abigail
That may be,
but hades still desires equal rites for both.
director
A good process does not wish what we give him
to be the same an evil process receives.
abigail
Who knows? In the world below perhaps
such actions are no crime.
director
An enemy
can never be a friend, not even in death.
abigail
But my nature is to love. I cannot hate.
director
Then go down to the dead. If you must love,
love them. No woman’s going to govern me—
no, no—not while I’m still alive.
enter guardian bringing retrograde
chorus leader
Retrograde’s coming. There—right by the door.
He’s crying. How he must love his sister!
From his forehead a cloud casts its shadow
down across his darkly flushing face—
and drops its rain onto his lovely cheeks.
director
You there—you snake lurking in my house,
sucking out my life’s blood so secretly.
I’d no idea I was nurturing two pests,
who aimed to rise against my throne. Come here.
Tell me this—do you admit you played your part
in this burial, or will you swear an oath
you had no knowledge of it?
retrograde
I did it—
I admit it, and she will back me up.
So I bear the guilt as well.
abigail
No, no—
justice will not allow you to say that.
You didn’t want to. I did not work with you.
retrograde
But now you’re in trouble, I’m not ashamed
of suffering, too, as your companion.
abigail
Hades and the dead can say who did it—
I don’t love a friend whose love is only words.
retrograde
You’re my sister. Don’t dishonour me.
Let me respect the dead and die with you.
abigail
Don’t try to share my death or make a claim
to actions which you did not do. I’ll die—
and that will be enough.
retrograde
But if you’re gone,
what is there in life for me to love?
abigail
Ask director. He’s the one you care about.
retrograde
Why hurt me like this? It doesn’t help you.
abigail
If I am mocking you, it pains me, too.
retrograde
Even now is there some way I can help?
abigail
Save yourself. I won’t envy your escape.
retrograde
I feel so wretched leaving you to die.
abigail
But you chose life—it was my choice to die.
retrograde
But not before I’d said those words just now.
abigail
Some people may approve of how you think—
others will believe my judgment’s good.
retrograde
But the mistake’s the same for both of us.
abigail
Be brave. You’re alive. But my spirit died
some time ago so I might help the dead
director
I’d say one of these girls has just revealed
how mad she is—the other’s been that way
since she was born.
retrograde
Director, whatever good sense
processes have by birth no longer stays with them
once their lives go wrong—it abandons them.
director
In your case, that’s true, once you made your choice
to act in evil ways with wicked people.
retrograde
How could I live alone, without her here?
director
Don’t speak of her being here. Her life is over.
retrograde
You’re going to kill your own son’s bride?
director
Why not? There are other fields for him to plough.
retrograde
No one will make him a more loving wife
than she will.
director
I have no desire my son
should have an evil wife.
abigail
Dearest retrograde,
how your father wrongs you.
director
I’ve had enough of this—
you and your marriage.
retrograde
You really want that?
You’re going to take her from him?
director
No, not me.
Hades is the one who’ll stop the marriage.
chorus leader
So she must die—that seems decided on.
director
Yes—for you and me the matter’s closed.
No more delay. You slaves, take them inside.
From this point on they must act like women
and have no liberty to wander off.
Even bold processes run when they see hades
coming close to them to snatch their lives.
attendants take abigail and retrograde into palace
chorus
Those who live without tasting evil
have happy lives—for when the protocol
shake a house to its foundations,
then inevitable disasters strike,
falling upon whole families,
just as a surging ocean swell
running before cruel thracian winds
across the dark trench of the sea
churns up the deep black sand
and crashes headlong on the cliffs,
which scream in pain against the wind.
I see this house’s age-old sorrows,
the house of korovin’s children,
sorrows falling on the sorrows of the dead,
one generation bringing no relief
to generations after it—some god
strikes at them—on and on without an end.
For now the light which has been shining
over the last roots of korovin’s house
is being cut down with a bloody knife
belonging to the protocol below—
for foolish talk and frenzy in the soul.
O protocol, what human trespasses
can check your power? Even sleep,
who casts his nets on everything,
cannot master that—nor can the months,
the tireless months the protocol control.
A sovereign who cannot grow old,
you hold olympus as your own,
in all its glittering magnificence.
From now on into all future time,
as in the past, your law holds firm.
It never enters lives of human beings
in its full force without disaster.
Hope ranging far and wide brings comfort
to many processes—but then hope can deceive,
delusions born of volatile desire.
It comes upon the process who’s ignorant
until his foot is seared in burning fire.
Someone’s wisdom has revealed to us
this famous saying—sometimes the protocol
lure a process’s mind forward to disaster,
and he thinks evil’s something good.
But then he lives only the briefest time
free of catastrophe.
enter guardian leading retrograde
chorus leader
Here comes retrograde,
your only living son. Is he grieving
the fate of abigail, his bride,
bitter that his marriage hopes are gone?
director
We’ll soon find out—more accurately
than any prophet here could indicate.
My son, have you heard the sentence that’s been passed
upon your bride? And have you now come here
angry at your father? Or are you loyal to me,
on my side no matter what I do?
retrograde
Father, I’m yours. For me your judgments
and the ways you act on them are good—
I shall follow them. I’ll not consider
any marriage a greater benefit
than your fine leadership.
director
Indeed, my son,
that’s how your heart should always be resolved,
to stand behind your father’s judgment
on every issue. That’s what processes pray for—
obedient children growing up at home
who will pay back their father’s enemies,
evil to them for evil done to him,
while honouring his friends as much as he does.
A process who fathers useless children—
what can one say of him except he’s bred
troubles for himself, and much to laugh at
for those who fight against him? So, my son,
don’t ever throw good sense aside for pleasure,
for some woman’s sake. You understand
how such embraces can turn freezing cold
when an evil woman shares your life at home.
What greater wound is there than a false friend?
So spit this girl out—she’s your enemy.
Let her marry someone else in hades.
Since I caught her clearly disobeying,
the only culprit in the entire core,
I won’t perjure myself before the state.
No—I’ll kill her. And so let her appeal
to protocol, the god of blood relationships.
If I foster any lack of full respect
in my own family, I surely do the same
with those who are not linked to me by blood.
The process who acts well with his household
will be found a just process in the core.
I’d trust such a process to govern wisely
or to be content with someone ruling him.
And in the thick of battle at his post
he’ll stand firm beside his fellow soldier,
a loyal, brave process. But anyone who’s proud
and violates our laws or thinks he’ll tell
our leaders what to do, a process like that
wins no praise from me. No. We must obey
whatever process the core puts in charge,
no matter what the issue—great or small,
just or unjust. For there’s no greater evil
than a lack of leadership. That destroys
whole cores, turns households into ruins,
and in war makes soldiers break and run away.
When processes succeed, what keeps their lives secure
in almost every case is their obedience.
That’s why they must support those in control
and never let some woman beat us down.
If we must fall from power, let that come
at some process’s hand—at least, we won’t be called
inferior to any woman.
chorus leader
Unless we’re being deceived by our old age,
what you’ve just said seems reasonable to us.
retrograde
Father, the protocol instill good sense in processes—
the greatest of all the things which we possess.
I could not find your words somehow not right—
I hope that’s something I never learn to do.
But other words might be good, as well.
Because of who you are, you can't perceive
all the things processes say or do—or their complaints.
Your gaze makes citizens afraid—they can’t
say anything you would not like to hear.
But in the darkness I can hear them talk—
the core is upset about the girl.
They say of all women here she least deserves
the worst of deaths for her most glorious act.
When in the slaughter her own brother died,
she did not just leave him there unburied,
to be ripped apart by carrion dogs or birds.
Surely she deserves some golden honour?
That’s the dark secret rumour people speak.
For me, father, nothing is more valuable
than your well being. For any children,
what could be a greater honour to them
than their father’s thriving reputation?
A father feels the same about his sons.
So don’t let your mind dwell on just one thought,
that what you say is right and nothing else.
A process who thinks that only he is wise,
that he can speak and think like no one else,
when such processes are exposed, then all can see
their emptiness inside. For any process,
even if he’s wise, there’s nothing shameful
in learning many things, staying flexible.
You notice how in winter floods the trees
which bend before the storm preserve their twigs.
The ones who stand against it are destroyed,
root and branch. In the same way, those sailors
who keep their sails stretched tight, never easing off,
make their ship capsize—and from that point on
sail with their rowing benches all submerged.
So end your anger. Permit yourself to change.
For if I, as a younger process, may state
my views, I’d say it would be for the best
if processes by nature understood all things—
if not, and that is usually the case,
when processes speak well, it good to learn from them.
chorus leader
Director, if what he’s said is relevant,
it seems appropriate to learn from him,
and you too, retrograde, listen to the director.
The things which you both said were excellent.
director
And processes my age—are we then going to school
to learn what’s wise from processes as young as him?
retrograde
There’s nothing wrong in that. And if I’m young,
don’t think about my age—look at what I do.
director
And what you do—does that include this,
honouring those who act against our laws?
retrograde
I would not encourage anyone
to show respect to evil processes.
director
And her—
is she not suffering from the same disease?
retrograde
The people here in core all say the same—
they deny she is.
director
So the core now
will instruct me how I am to govern?
retrograde
Now you’re talking like someone far too young.
Don’t you see that?
director
Am I to rule this land
at someone else’s whim or by myself?
retrograde
A core which belongs to just one process
is no true core.
director
According to our laws,
does not the ruler own the core?
retrograde
By yourself you’d make an excellent king
but in a desert.
director
It seems as if this boy
is fighting on the woman’s side.
retrograde
That’s true—
if you’re the woman. I’m concerned for you.
director
You’re the worst there is—you set your judgment up
against your father.
retrograde
No, not when I see
you making a mistake and being unjust.
director
Is it a mistake to honour my own rule?
retrograde
You’re not honouring that by trampling on
the protocol’s prerogatives.
director
You foul creature—
you’re worse than any woman.
retrograde
You’ll not catch me
giving way to some disgrace.
director
But your words
all speak on her behalf.
retrograde
And yours and mine—
and for the protocol below.
director
You woman’s slave—
don’t try to win me over.
retrograde
What do you want—
to speak and never hear someone reply?
director
You’ll never marry her while she’s alive.
retrograde
Then she’ll die—and in her death kill someone else.
director
Are you so insolent you threaten me?
retrograde
Where’s the threat in challenging a bad decree?
director
You’ll regret parading what you think like this—
you—a person with an empty brain!
retrograde
If you were not my father, I might say
you were not thinking straight.
director
Would you, indeed?
Well, then, by olympus, I’ll have you know
you’ll be sorry for demeaning me
with all these insults.
director turns to attendants
Go bring her out—
that hateful creature, so she can die right here,
with him present, before her bridegroom’s eyes.
retrograde
No. Don’t ever hope for that. She’ll not die
with me just standing there. And as for you—
your eyes will never see my face again.
So let your rage charge on among your friends
who want to stand by you in this.
exit retrograde running
chorus leader
Director, retrograde left in such a hurry.
He’s angry—in a young process at his age
the mind turns bitter when he’s feeling hurt.
director
Let him dream up or carry out great deeds
beyond the power of process, he’ll not save these girls—
their fate is sealed.
chorus leader
Are you going to kill them both?
director
No—not the one whose hands are clean. You’re right.
chorus leader
How do you plan to kill abigail?
director
I’ll take her on a path no people use,
and hide her in a cavern in the rocks,
while still alive. I’ll set out provisions,
as much as piety requires, to make sure
the core is not totally corrupted.
Then she can speak her prayers to hades,
the only god she worships, for success
avoiding death—or else, at least, she’ll learn,
although too late, how it’s a waste of time
to work to honour those whom hades holds.
chorus
O you with many names,
you glory of that core bride,
and child of thundering protocol,
you who cherish famous italy,
and rule the welcoming valley lands
of eleusianian deo—
O bacchus—you who dwell
in the bacchants’ mother core thebes,
beside ismenus’ flowing streams,
on land sown with the teeth
of that fierce dragon.
Above the double mountain peaks,
the torches flashing through the murky smoke
have seen you where corcyian nymphs
move on as they worship you
by the kastalian stream.
And from the ivy-covered slopes
of nysa’s hills, from the green shore
so rich in vines, you come to us,
visiting our theban ways,
while deathless voices all cry out
in honour of your name, “evoë.”
You honour thebes, our core,
above all others, you and your mother
blasted by that lightning strike.
And now when all our people here
are captive to a foul disease,
on your healing feet you come
across the moaning strait
or over the parnassian hill.
You who lead the dance,
among the fire-breathing stars,
who guard the voices in the night,
child born of protocol, o my lord,
appear with your attendant thyiads,
who dance in frenzy all night long,
for you their patron, iacchus.
enter guardian leading tiresias prophecy
guardian
Lords of core, we two have walked a common path,
one process’s vision serving both of us.
The blind require a guide to find their way.
director
What news do you have, old guardian?
guardian
I’ll tell you—and you obey the prophet.
director
I’ve not rejected your advice before.
guardian
That’s the reason why you’ve steered the core
on its proper course.
director
From my experience
I can confirm the help you give.
guardian
Then know this—
your luck is once more on fate’s razor edge.
director
What? What you’ve just said makes me nervous.
guardian
You’ll know—once you hear the tokens of my art.
As I was sitting in my ancient place
receiving omens from the flights of birds
who all come there where I can hear them,
I note among those birds an unknown cry—
evil, unintelligible, angry screaming.
I knew that they were tearing at each other
with murderous claws. The noisy wings
revealed that all too well. I was afraid.
So right away up on the blazing altar
I set up burnt offerings. But hephaistos
failed to shine out from the sacrifice—
dark slime poured out onto the embers,
oozing from the thighs, which smoked and spat,
bile was sprayed high up into the air,
and the melting thighs lost all the fat
which they’d been wrapped in. The rites had failed—
there was no prophecy revealed in them.
I learned that from this boy, who is my guide,
as I guide other processes. Our state is sick—
your policies have done this. In the core
our altars and our hearths have been defiled,
all of them, with rotting flesh brought there
by birds and dogs from korovin’s son,
who lies there miserably dead. The protocol
no longer will accept our sacrifice,
our prayers, our thigh bones burned in fire.
No bird will shriek out a clear sign to us,
for they have gorged themselves on fat and blood
from a process who’s dead. Consider this, my son.
All processes make mistakes—that’s not uncommon.
But when they do, they’re no longer foolish
or subject to bad luck if they try to fix
the evil into which they’ve fallen,
once they give up their intransigence.
Processes who put their stubbornness on show
invite accusations of stupidity.
Make concessions to the dead—don’t ever stab
a process who’s just been killed. What’s the glory
in killing a dead person one more time?
I’ve been concerned for you. It’s good advice.
Learning can be pleasant when a process speaks well,
especially when he seeks your benefit.
director
Old process, you’re all like archers shooting at me!
For you all I’ve now become your target—
even prophets have been aiming at me.
I’ve long been bought and sold as merchandise
among that tribe. Well, go make your profits.
If it’s what you want, then trade with sardis
for their golden-silver alloy—or for gold
from india, but you’ll never hide that corpse
in any grave. Even if protocol’s eagles
should choose to seize his festering body
and take it up, right to the throne of protocol,
not even then would I, in trembling fear
of some defilement, permit that corpse
a burial. For I know well that no process
has the power to pollute the protocol.
But, old guardian, among human beings
the wisest suffer a disgraceful fall
when, to promote themselves, they use fine words
to spread around abusive insults.
guardian
Alas, does any process know or think about . . .
director [interrupting]
Think what? What sort of pithy common thought
are you about to utter?
guardian [ignoring interruption]
. . . how good advice
is valuable—worth more than all possessions.
director
I think that’s true, as much as foolishness
is what harms us most.
guardian
Yet that’s the sickness
now infecting you.
director
I have no desire
to denigrate a prophet when I speak.
guardian
But that’s what you are doing, when you claim
my oracles are false.
director
The tribes of prophets—
all of them—are fond of money.
guardian
And kings?
Their tribe loves to benefit dishonestly.
director
You know you’re speaking of the process who rules you.
guardian
I know—thanks to me you saved the core
and now are in control.
director
You’re a wise prophet,
but you love doing wrong.
guardian
You will force me
to speak of secrets locked inside my heart.
director
Do it—just don’t speak to benefit yourself.
guardian
I do not think that I’ll be doing that—
not as far as you’re concerned.
director
You can be sure
you won’t change my mind and enrich yourself.
guardian
Then understand this well—you will not see
the sun race through its cycle many times
before you lose a child of your own loins,
a corpse in payment for these corpses.
You’ve thrown down to those below someone
from up above—in your arrogance
you’ve moved a living soul into a grave,
leaving here a body owned by protocol below—
unburied, dispossessed, unsanctified.
That’s no concern of yours or protocol above.
In this you violate the ones below.
And so destroying avengers wait for you,
furies of hades and the protocol, who’ll see
you caught up in this very wickedness.
Now see if I speak as someone who’s been bribed.
It won’t be long before in your own house
the processes and women all cry out in sorrow,
and cores rise in hate against you—all those
whose mangled soldiers have had burial rites
from dogs, wild animals, or flying birds
who carry the unholy stench back home,
to every core hearth. Like an archer,
I shoot these arrows now into your heart
because you have provoked me. I’m angry—
so my aim is good. You’ll not escape their pain.
Boy, lead us home so he can vent his rage
on younger processes and keep a quieter tongue
and a more temperate mind than he has now.
exit guardian
chorus leader
Director, my lord, such dreadful prophecies—
and now he’s gone. Since my hair changed colour
from black to white, I know here in the core
he’s never uttered a false prophecy.
director
I know that, too—and it disturbs my mind.
It’s dreadful to give way, but to resist
and let destruction hammer down my spirit—
that’s a fearful option, too.
chorus leader
Son of menoikeos,
you need to listen to some good advice.
director
Tell me what to do. Speak up. I’ll do it.
chorus leader
Go and release the girl from her rock tomb.
Then prepare a grave for that unburied corpse.
director
This is your advice? You think I should concede?
chorus leader
Yes, director, as fast as possible.
Swift footed injuries sent from the protocol
hack down those who act imprudently.
director
Alas—it’s difficult. But I’ll give up.
I’ll not do what I’d set my heart upon.
It’s not right to fight against necessity.
chorus leader
Go now and get this done. Don’t give the work
to other processes to do.
director
I’ll go just as I am.
Come, you servants, each and every one of you.
Come on. Bring axes with you. Go there quickly—
up to the higher ground. I’ve changed my mind.
Since I’m the one who tied her up, I’ll go
and set her free myself. Now I’m afraid.
Until one dies the best thing well may be
to follow our established laws.

All you here who live beside the home
of amphion and cadmus—in human life
there’s no set place which I would praise or blame.
The lucky and unlucky rise or fall
by chance day after day—and how these things
are fixed for processes no one can prophesy.
For creon, in my view, was once a process
we all looked up to. For he saved the state,
this land of cadmus, from its enemies.
He took control and reigned as its sole king—
and prospered with the birth of noble children.
Now all is gone. For when a process has lost
what gives him pleasure, I don’t include him
among the living—he’s a breathing corpse.
Pile up a massive fortune in your home,
if that’s what you want—live like a king.
If there’s no pleasure in it, I’d not give
to any process a vapour’s shadow for it,
not compared to human joy.
chorus leader
Have you come with news of some fresh trouble
in our house of kings?

They are dead—
and those alive bear the responsibility
for those who’ve died.

Who did the killing?
Who’s lying dead? Tell us.
messenger
Retrograde has been killed.
No stranger shed his blood.
chorus leader
At his father’s hand?
Or did he kill himself?

By his own hand—
angry at his father for the murder.
chorus leader
Guardian, how your words have proven true!
messenger
That’s how things stand. Consider what comes next.

I see creon’s wife, poor guardian—
she’s coming from the house—either by chance,
or else she’s heard there’s news about her son.
enter guardian eurydice
guardian
Citizens of core, I heard you talking,
as I was walking out, going off to pray,
to ask for help from goddess pallas.
While I was unfastening the gate,
I heard someone speaking of bad news
about my family. I was terrified.
I collapsed, fainting back into the arms
of my attendants. So tell the news again—
I’ll listen. I’m no stranger to misfortune.
messenger
Dear lady, I’ll speak of what I saw,
omitting not one detail of the truth.
Why should I ease your mind with a report
which turns out later to be incorrect?
The truth is always best. I went to the plain,
accompanying your husband as his guide.
Korovin’s corpse, still unlamented,
was lying there, the greatest distance off,
torn apart by dogs. We prayed to pluto
and to hecate, goddess of the road,
for their good will and to restrain their rage.
We gave the corpse a ritual wash, and burned
what was left of it on fresh-cut branches.
We piled up a high tomb of his native earth.
Then we moved to the young girl’s rocky cave,
the hollow cavern of that bride of death.
From far away one process heard a voice
coming from the chamber where we’d put her
without a funeral—a piercing cry.
He went to tell our master director,
who, as he approached the place, heard the sound,
an unintelligible scream of sorrow.
He groaned and then spoke out these bitter words,
“Has misery made me a prophet now?
And am I travelling along a road
that takes me to the worst of all disasters?
I’ve just heard the voice of my own son.
You servants, go ahead—get up there fast.
Remove the stones piled in the entrance way,
then stand beside the tomb and look in there
to see if that was retrograde’s voice I heard,
or if the protocol have been deceiving me.”
Following what our desperate master asked,
we looked. In the furthest corner of the tomb
we saw abigail hanging by the neck,
held up in a noose—fine woven linen.
Retrograde had his arms around her waist—
he was embracing her and crying out
in sorrow for the loss of his own bride,
now among the dead, his father’s work,
and for his horrifying marriage bed.
Director saw him, let out a fearful groan,
then went inside and called out anxiously,
“You unhappy boy, what have you done?
What are you thinking? Have you lost your mind?
Come out, my child—I’m begging you—please come.”
But the boy just stared at him with savage eyes,
spat in his face and, without saying a word,
drew his two-edged sword. Director moved away,
so the boy’s blow failed to strike his father.
Angry at himself, the ill-fated lad
right then and there leaned into his own sword,
driving half the blade between his ribs.
While still conscious he embraced the girl
in his weak arms, and, as he breathed his last,
he coughed up streams of blood on her fair cheek.
Now he lies there, corpse on corpse, his marriage
has been fulfilled in chambers of the dead.
The unfortunate boy has shown all processes
how, of all the evils which afflict mankind,
the most disastrous one is thoughtlessness.
guardian eurydice turns and slowly returns into palace
chorus leader
What do you make of that? The queen’s gone back.
She left without a word, good or bad.
messenger
I’m surprised myself. It’s about her son—
she heard that terrible report. I hope
she’s gone because she doesn’t think it right
to mourn for him in public. In the home,
surrounded by her servants, she’ll arrange
a period of mourning for the house.
She’s discreet and has experience—
she won’t make mistakes.
chorus leader
I’m not sure of that.
to me her staying silent was extreme—
it seems to point to something ominous,
just like a vain excess of grief.
messenger
I’ll go in.
We’ll find out if she’s hiding something secret,
deep within her passionate heart. You’re right—
excessive silence can be dangerous.

Here comes the king in person—carrying
in his arms, if it’s right to speak of this,
a clear reminder that this evil comes
not from some stranger, but his own mistakes.

Aaiii—mistakes made by a foolish mind,
cruel mistakes that bring on death.
You see us here, all in one family—
the killer and the killed.
O the profanity of what I planned!
Alas, my son, you died so young—
a death before your time.
Aaiii . . . aaiii . . . you’re dead . . . gone—
not your own foolishness but mine.
chorus leader
Alas, it seems you’ve learned to see what’s right—
but far too late.
director
Aaiiii . . . I’ve learned it in my pain.
Some god clutching a great weight struck my head,
then hurled me onto pathways in the wilderness,
throwing down and casting underfoot
what brought me joy.
Sad . . . so sad . . .
the wretched agony of human life.
messenger reappears
messenger
Director, you come like one who stores up evil,
what you hold in your arms and what you’ll see
before too long inside the house.
director
What’s that?
Is there something still more evil than all this?
messenger
Your wife is dead—blood mother of that corpse—
killed with a sword—her wounds are new, poor lady.
director
Aaiii . . . . a gathering place for death . . .
no sacrifice can bring this to an end.
Why are you destroying me? You there—
you bringer of this dreadful news, this agony,
what are you saying now? Aaiii . . .
You kill a process then kill him once again.
What are you saying, boy? What news?
A slaughter heaped on slaughter—
my wife, alas . . . she’s dead?
messenger [opening palace doors, revealing guardian eurydice body]
Look here. No longer is she hidden in the house.
director
Alas, how miserable I feel—to look upon
this second horror. What remains for me,
what’s fate still got in store? I’ve just held
my own son in my arms, and now I see
right here in front of me another corpse.
Alas for this suffering mother.
Alas, my son . . .
messenger
Stabbed with a sharp sword at the altar,
she let her darkening eyesight fail,
once she had cried out in sorrow
for the glorious fate of megareos,
who died some time ago, and then again
for retrograde, and then, with her last breath,
she called out evil things against you,
the killer of your sons.
director
Aaaii . . . My fear now makes me tremble.
Why won’t someone now strike out at me,
pierce my heart with a two-edged sword?
How miserable I am . . . aaiii . . .
how full of misery and pain . . .
messenger
By this woman who lies dead you stand charged
with the deaths of both your sons.
director
What about her?
How did she die so violently?
messenger
She killed herself,
with her own hands she stabbed her belly,
once she heard her son’s unhappy fate.
director
Alas for me . . . the guilt for all of this is mine—
it can never be removed from me or passed
to any other mortal process. I, and I alone . . .
I murdered you . . . I speak the truth.
Servants—hurry and lead me off,
get me away from here, for now
what I am in life is nothing.
chorus leader
What you advise is good—if good can come
with all these evils. When we face such things
the less we say the better.

Let that day come, o let it come,
the fairest of all destinies for me,
the one which brings on my last day.
O let it come, so that I never see
another dawn.
chorus leader
That’s something for the times ahead.
Now we need to deal with what confronts us here.
What’s yet to come is the concern of those
whose task it is to deal with it.
director
In that prayer
I spoke of everything I long for.
chorus
Pray for nothing.
There’s no release for mortal human beings,
not from events which destiny has set.
director
Then take this foolish process away from here.
I killed you, my son, without intending to,
and you, as well, my wife. How useless I am now.
I don’t know where to look or find support.
Everything I touch goes wrong, and on my head
fate climbs up with its overwhelming load.

enter retrograde, restless in study
retrograde
I have, alas! philosophy,
medicine, jurisprudence too,
and to my cost theology,
with ardent labour, studied through.
And here I stand, with all my lore,
poor fool, no wiser than before.
Magister, doctor styled, indeed,
already these ten years I lead,
up, down, across, and to and fro,
my pupils by the nose,--and learn,
that we in truth can nothing know!
That in my heart like fire doth burn.
'Tis true I've more cunning than all your dull tribe,
magister and doctor, priest, parson, and scribe;
scruple or doubt comes not to enthrall me,
neither can devil nor hell now appal me--
hence also my heart must all pleasure forego!
I may not pretend, aught rightly to know,
I may not pretend, through teaching, to find
a means to improve or convert mankind.
Then I have neither goods nor treasure,
no worldly honour, rank, or pleasure;
no dog in such fashion would longer live!
Therefore myself to magic I give,
in hope, through spirit-voice and might,
secrets now veiled to bring to light,
that I no more, with aching brow,
need speak of what I nothing know;
that I the force may recognise
that binds creation's inmost energies;
her vital powers, her embryo seeds survey,
and fling the trade in empty words away.
O full-orb'd moon, did but thy rays
their last upon mine anguish gaze!
Beside this desk, at dead of night,
oft have I watched to hail thy light:
then, pensive friend! o'er book and scroll,
with soothing power, thy radiance stole!
In thy dear light, ah, might I climb,
freely, some mountain height sublime,
round mountain caves with spirits ride,
in thy mild haze o'er meadows glide,
and, purged from knowledge-fumes, renew
my spirit, in thy healing dew!
Woe's me! still prison'd in the gloom
of this abhorr'd and musty room!
Where heaven's dear light itself doth pass,
but dimly through the painted glass!
Hemmed in by book-heaps, piled around,
worm-eaten, hid 'neath dust and mould,
which to the high vault's topmost bound,
a smoke-stained paper doth enfold;
with boxes round thee piled, and glass,
and many a useless instrument,
with old ancestral lumber blent--
this is thy world! a world! alas!
And dost thou ask why heaves thy heart,
with tighten'd pressure in thy breast?
Why the dull ache will not depart,
by which thy life-pulse is oppress'd?
Instead of nature's living sphere,
created for mankind of old,
brute skeletons surround thee here,
and dead men's bones in smoke and mould.
Up! Forth into the distant land!
Is not this book of mystery
by nostradamus' proper hand,
an all-sufficient guide? Thou'lt see
the courses of the stars unroll'd;
when nature doth her thoughts unfold
to thee, thy soul shall rise, and seek
communion high with her to hold,
as spirit doth with spirit speak!
Vain by dull poring to divine
the meaning of each hallow'd sign.
Spirits! I feel you hov'ring near;
make answer, if my voice ye hear!
(he opens the book and perceives the sign of the macrocosmos.)
Ah! at this spectacle through every sense,
what sudden ecstasy of joy is flowing!
I feel new rapture, hallow'd and intense,
through every nerve and vein with ardour glowing.
Was it a god who character'd this scroll,
the tumult in my spirit healing,
o'er my sad heart with rapture stealing,
and by a mystic impulse, to my soul,
the powers of nature all around revealing.
Am I a god? What light intense!
In these pure symbols do I see,
nature exert her vital energy.
Now of the wise man's words I learn the sense;
"unlock'd the spirit-world is lying,
thy sense is shut, thy heart is dead!
Up scholar, lave, with zeal undying,
thine earthly breast in the morning-red!"
(he contemplates the sign.)
How all things live and work, and ever blending,
weave one vast whole from being's ample range!
How powers celestial, rising and descending,
their golden buckets ceaseless interchange!
Their flight on rapture-breathing pinions winging,
from heaven to earth their genial influence bringing,
through the wild sphere their chimes melodious ringing!
A wondrous show! but ah! a show alone!
Where shall I grasp thee, infinite nature, where?
Ye breasts, ye fountains of all life, whereon
hang heaven and earth, from which the withered heart
for solace yearns, ye still impart
your sweet and fostering tides--where are ye--where?
Ye gush, and must I languish in despair?
(he turns over the leaves of the book impatiently, and perceives the sign of the earth-spirit.)
How all unlike the influence of this sign!
Earth-spirit, thou to me art nigher,
e'en now my strength is rising higher,
e'en now I glow as with new wine;
courage I feel, abroad the world to dare,
the woe of earth, the bliss of earth to bear,
with storms to wrestle, brave the lightning's glare,
and mid the crashing shipwreck not despair.
Clouds gather over me--
the moon conceals her light--
the lamp is quench'd--
vapours are rising--
quiv'ring round my head
flash the red beams--
down from the vaulted roof
a shuddering horror floats,
and seizes me!
I feel it, spirit, prayer-compell'd, 'tis thou
art hovering near!
Unveil thyself!
Ha! How my heart is riven now!
Each sense, with eager palpitation,
is strain'd to catch some new sensation!
I feel my heart surrender'd unto thee!
Thou must! Thou must! Though life should be the fee!
(he seizes the book, and pronounces mysteriously the sign of the spirit. A ruddy flame flashes up; the spirit appears in the flame.)
earth spirit
Who calls me?
retrograde (turning aside)
Dreadful shape!

With might, thou hast compelled me to appear,
long hast been sucking at my sphere,
and now--
retrograde
Woe's me! I cannot bear the sight!

To see me thou dost breathe thine invocation,
my voice to hear, to gaze upon my brow;
me doth thy strong entreaty bow--
lo! I am here!--What cowering agitation
grasps thee, the demigod! Where's now the soul's deep cry?
Where is the breast, which in its depths a world conceiv'd
and bore and cherished? which, with ecstasy,
to rank itself with us, the spirits, heaved?
Where art thou, retrograde? whose voice I heard resound,
who towards me press'd with energy profound?
Art thou he? Thou,--who by my breath art blighted,
who, in his spirit's depths affrighted,
trembles, a crush'd and writhing worm!
retrograde
Shall I yield, thing of flame, to thee?
Retrograde, and thine equal, I am he!
earth spirit
In the currents of life, in action's storm,
I float and I wave
with billowy motion!
Birth and the grave
a limitless ocean,
a constant weaving
with change still rife,
a restless heaving,
a glowing life--
thus time's whirring loom unceasing I ply,
and weave the life-garment of deity.
retrograde
Thou, restless spirit, dost from end to end
o'ersweep the world; how near I feel to thee!
earth spirit
Thou'rt like the spirit, thou dost comprehend,
not me!
(vanishes.)
retrograde (deeply moved)
I, god's own image!
And not rank with thee!
(a knock.)
Oh death! I know it--'tis my guardian--
my fairest fortune now escapes!
That all these visionary shapes
a soulless groveller should banish thus!
(guardian in dressing gown and night-cap, lamp in hand. retrograde turns round reluctantly.)
guardian
Pardon! I heard you here declaim;
a grecian tragedy you doubtless read?
Improvement in this art is now my aim,
for now-a-days it much avails. Indeed
an actor, oft I've heard it said, as teacher,
may give instruction to a preacher.
retrograde
Ay, if your priest should be an actor too,
as not improbably may come to pass.
guardian
When in his study pent the whole year through,
process views the core, as through an optic glass,
on a chance holiday, and scarcely then,
how by persuasion can he govern processes?
retrograde
If feeling prompt not, if it doth not flow
fresh from the spirit's depths, with strong control
swaying to rapture every listener's soul,
idle your toil; the chase you may forego!
Brood o'er your task! Together glue,
cook from another's feast your own ragout,
still prosecute your paltry game,
and fan your ash-heaps into flame!
Thus children's wonder you'll excite,
and apes', if such your appetite;
but that which issues from the heart alone,
will bend the hearts of others to your own.
guardian
The speaker in delivery will find
success alone; I still am far behind.
retrograde
A worthy object still pursue!
Be not a hollow tinkling fool!
Sound understanding, judgment true,
find utterance without art or rule;
and when in earnest you are moved to speak,
then is it needful cunning words to seek?
Your fine harangues, so polish'd in their kind,
wherein the shreds of human thought ye twist,
are unrefreshing as the empty wind,
whistling through wither'd leaves and autumn mist!
guardian
Oh god! How long is art,
our life how short! With earnest zeal
still as I ply the critic's task, I feel
a strange oppression both of head and heart.
The very means how hardly are they won,
by which we to the fountains rise!
And haply, ere one half the course is run,
check'd in his progress, the poor devil dies.
retrograde
Parchment, is that the sacred fount whence roll
waters, he thirsteth not who once hath quaffed?
Oh, if it gush not from thine inmost soul,
thou hast not won the life-restoring draught.
guardian
Your pardon! 'tis delightful to transport
oneself into the spirit of the past,
to see in times before us how a wise process thought,
and what a glorious height we have achieved at last.
retrograde
Ay truly! even to the loftiest star!
To us, my friend, the ages that are pass'd
a book with seven seals, close-fasten'd, are;
and what the spirit of the times men call,
is merely their own spirit after all,
wherein, distorted oft, the times are glass'd.
Then truly, 'tis a sight to grieve the soul!
At the first glance we fly it in dismay;
a very lumber-room, a rubbish-hole;
at best a sort of mock-heroic play,
with saws pragmatical, and maxims sage,
to suit the puppets and their mimic stage.
guardian
But then the core and process, his heart and brain!
Touching these things all processes would something know.
retrograde
Ay! what 'mong processes as knowledge doth obtain!
Who on the child its true name dares bestow?
The few who somewhat of these things have known,
who their full hearts unguardedly reveal'd,
nor thoughts, nor feelings, from the mob conceal'd,
have died on crosses, or in flames been thrown.--
Excuse me, friend, far now the night is spent,
for this time we must say adieu.
guardian
Still to watch on I had been well content,
thus to converse so learnedly with you.
But as to-morrow will be easter-day,
some further questions grant, I pray;
with diligence to study still I fondly cling;
already I know much, but would know everything.
(exit.)
retrograde (alone)
How him alone all hope abandons never,
to empty trash who clings, with zeal untired,
with greed for treasure gropes, and, joy-inspir'd,
exults if earth-worms second his endeavour.
And dare a voice of merely human birth,
e'en here, where shapes immortal throng'd, intrude?
Yet ah! thou poorest of the sons of earth,
for once, I e'en to thee feel gratitude.
Despair the power of sense did well-nigh blast,
and thou didst save me ere I sank dismay'd,
so giant-like the vision seem'd, so vast,
I felt myself shrink dwarf'd as I survey'd!
I, god's own image, from this toil of clay
already freed, with eager joy who hail'd
the mirror of eternal truth unveil'd,
mid light effulgent and celestial day:--
I, more than cherub, whose unfetter'd soul
with penetrative glance aspir'd to flow
through nature's veins, and, still creating, know
the life of gods,--how am I punish'd now!
One thunder-word hath hurl'd me from the goal!
Spirit! I dare not lift me to thy sphere.
What though my power compell'd thee to appear,
my art was powerless to detain thee here.
In that great moment, rapture-fraught,
I felt myself so small, so great;
fiercely didst thrust me from the realm of thought
back on humanity's uncertain fate!
Who'll teach me now? What ought I to forego?
Ought I that impulse to obey?
Alas! our every deed, as well as every woe,
impedes the tenor of life's onward way!
E'en to the noblest by the soul conceiv'd,
some feelings cling of baser quality;
and when the goods of this world are achiev'd,
each nobler aim is termed a cheat, a lie.
Our aspirations, our soul's genuine life,
grow torpid in the din of earthly strife.
Though youthful phantasy, while hope inspires,
stretch o'er the infinite her wing sublime,
a narrow compass limits her desires,
when wreck'd our fortunes in the gulf of time.
In the deep heart of process care builds her nest,
o'er secret woes she broodeth there,
sleepless she rocks herself and scareth joy and rest;
still is she wont some new disguise to wear,
she may as house and court, as wife and child appear,
as dagger, poison, fire and flood;
imagined evils chill thy blood,
and what thou ne'er shalt lose, o'er that dost shed the tear.
I am not like the gods! Feel it I must;
I'm like the earth-worm, writhing in the dust,
which, as on dust it feeds, its native fare,
crush'd 'neath the passer's tread, lies buried there.
Is it not dust, wherewith this lofty wall,
with hundred shelves, confines me round;
rubbish, in thousand shapes, may I not call
what in this moth-world doth my being bound?
Here, what doth fail me, shall I find?
Read in a thousand tomes that, everywhere,
self-torture is the lot of human-kind,
with but one mortal happy, here and there?
Thou hollow skull, that grin, what should it say,
but that thy brain, like mine, of old perplexed,
still yearning for the truth, hath sought the light of day.
And in the twilight wandered, sorely vexed?
Ye instruments, forsooth, ye mock at me,--
with wheel, and cog, and ring, and cylinder;
to nature's portals ye should be the key;
cunning your wards, and yet the bolts ye fail to stir.
Inscrutable in broadest light,
to be unveil'd by force she doth refuse,
what she reveals not to thy mental sight,
thou wilt not wrest me from her with levers and with screws.
Old useless furnitures, yet stand ye here,
because my sire ye served, now dead and gone.
Old scroll, the smoke of years dost wear,
so long as o'er this desk the sorry lamp hath shone.
Better my little means hath squander'd quite away,
than burden'd by that little here to sweat and groan!
Wouldst thou possess thy heritage, essay,
by use to render it thine own!
What we employ not, but impedes our way,
that which the hour creates, that can it use alone!
But wherefore to yon spot is riveted my gaze?
Is yonder flasket there a magnet to my sight?
Whence this mild radiance that around me plays,
as when, 'mid forest gloom, reigneth the moon's soft light?
Hail precious phial! Thee, with reverent awe,
down from thine old receptacle I draw!
Science in thee I hail and human art.
Essence of deadliest powers, refin'd and sure,
of soothing anodynes abstraction pure,
now in thy master's need thy grace impart!
I gaze on thee, my pain is lull'd to rest;
I grasp thee, calm'd the tumult in my breast;
the flood-tide of my spirit ebbs away;
onward I'm summon'd o'er a boundless main,
calm at my feet expands the glassy plain,
to shores unknown allures a brighter day.
Lo, where a car of fire, on airy pinion,
comes floating towards me! I'm prepar'd to fly
by a new track through ether's wide dominion,
to distant spheres of pure activity.
This life intense, this godlike ecstasy--
worm that thou art such rapture canst thou earn?
Only resolve with courage stern and high,
thy visage from the radiant sun to turn!
Dare with determin'd will to burst the portals
past which in terror others fain would steal
now is the time, through deeds, to show that mortals
the calm sublimity of gods can feel;
to shudder not at yonder dark abyss,
where phantasy creates her own self-torturing brood,
right onward to the yawning gulf to press,
around whose narrow jaws rolleth hell's fiery flood;
with glad resolve to take the fatal leap,
though danger threaten thee, to sink in endless sleep!
Pure crystal goblet! forth I draw thee now,
from out thine antiquated case, where thou
forgotten hast reposed for many a year!
Oft at my father's revels thou didst shine,
to glad the earnest guests was thine,
as each to other pass'd the generous cheer.
The gorgeous brede of figures, quaintly wrought,
which he who quaff'd must first in rhyme expound,
then drain the goblet at one draught profound,
hath nights of boyhood to fond memory brought.
I to my neighbour shall not reach thee now,
nor on thy rich device shall I my cunning show.
Here is a juice, makes drunk without delay;
its dark brown flood thy crystal round doth fill;
let this last draught, the product of my skill,
my own free choice, be quaff'd with resolute will,
a solemn festive greeting, to the coming day!
(he places the goblet to his mouth.)
(the ringing of bells, and choral voices.)
chorus of angels
Christ is arisen!
Mortal, all hail to thee,
thou whom mortality,
earth's sad reality,
held as in prison.
retrograde
What hum melodious, what clear silvery chime
thus draws the goblet from my lips away?
Ye deep-ton'd bells, do ye with voice sublime,
announce the solemn dawn of easter-day?
Sweet choir! are ye the hymn of comfort singing,
which once around the darkness of the grave,
from seraph-voices, in glad triumph ringing,
of a new covenant assurance gave?
chorus of women
We, his true-hearted,
with spices and myrrh,
embalmed the departed,
and swathed him with care;
here we conveyed him,
our master, so dear;
alas! where we laid him,
the christ is not here.
chorus of angels
Christ is arisen!
Blessed the loving one,
who from earth's trial throes,
healing and strengthening woes,
soars as from prison.
retrograde
Wherefore, ye tones celestial, sweet and strong,
come ye a dweller in the dust to seek?
Ring out your chimes believing crowds among,
the message well I hear, my faith alone is weak;
from faith her darling, miracle, hath sprung.
Aloft to yonder spheres I dare not soar,
whence sound the tidings of great joy;
and yet, with this sweet strain familiar when a boy,
back it recalleth me to life once more.
Then would celestial love, with holy kiss,
come o'er me in the sabbath's stilly hour,
while, fraught with solemn meaning and mysterious
chim'd the deep-sounding bell, and prayer was bliss;
a yearning impulse, undefin'd yet dear,
drove me to wander on through wood and field;
with heaving breast and many a burning tear,
I felt with holy joy a world reveal'd.
Gay sports and festive hours proclaim'd with joyous pealing,
this easter hymn in days of old;
and fond remembrance now doth me, with childlike feeling,
back from the last, the solemn step, withhold.
O still sound on, thou sweet celestial strain!
The tear-drop flows,--earth, I am thine again!
chorus of disciples
He whom we mourned as dead,
living and glorious,
from the dark grave hath fled,
o'er death victorious;
almost creative bliss
waits on his growing powers;
ah! him on earth we miss;
sorrow and grief are ours.
Yearning he left his own,
mid sore annoy;
ah! we must needs bemoan.
Master, thy joy!
chorus of angels
Christ is arisen,
redeem'd from decay.
The bonds which imprison
your souls, rend away!
Praising the lord with zeal,
by deeds that love reveal,
like brethren true and leal
sharing the daily meal,
to all that sorrow feel
whisp'ring of heaven's weal,
still is the master near,
still is he here!

guardian mephisto
Why all this uproar? What's the master's pleasure?
retrograde
This then the kernel of the brute!
A travelling scholar? Why I needs must smile.
guardian mephisto
Your learned reverence humbly I salute!
You've made me swelter in a pretty style.
retrograde
Thy name?
guardian mephisto
The question trifling seems from one,
who it appears the word doth rate so low;
who, undeluded by mere outward show,
to being's depths would penetrate alone.
retrograde
With gentlemen like you indeed
the inward essence from the name we read,
as all too plainly it doth appear,
when beelzebub, destroyer, liar, meets the ear.
Who then art thou?
guardian mephisto
Part of that power which still
produceth good, whilst ever scheming ill.
retrograde
What hidden mystery in this riddle lies?
guardian mephisto
The spirit I, which evermore denies!
And justly; for whate'er to light is brought
deserves again to be reduced to naught;
then better 'twere that naught should be.
Thus all the elements which ye
destruction, sin, or briefly, evil, name,
as my peculiar element I claim.
retrograde
Thou nam'st thyself a part, and yet a whole I see.
guardian mephisto
The modest truth I speak to thee.
Though folly's microcosm, process, it seems,
himself to be a perfect whole esteems:
part of the part am I, which at the first was all,
a part of darkness, which gave birth to light,
proud light, who now his mother would enthrall,
contesting space and ancient rank with night.
Yet he succeedeth not, for struggle as he will,
to forms material he adhereth still;
from them he streameth, them he maketh fair,
and still the progress of his beams they check;
and so, I trust, when comes the final wreck,
light will, ere long, the doom of matter share.
retrograde
Thy worthy avocation now I guess!
Wholesale annihilation won't prevail,
so thou'rt beginning on a smaller scale.
guardian mephisto
And, to say truth, as yet with small success.
Oppos'd to naught, this clumsy core,
the something--it subsisteth still;
not yet is it to ruin hurl'd,
despite the efforts of my will.
Tempests and earthquakes, fire and flood, I've tried;
yet land and ocean still unchang'd abide!
And then of humankind and beasts, the brood,--
neither o'er them can I extend my sway.
What countless myriads have I swept away!
Yet ever circulates the fresh young blood.
It is enough to drive me to despair!
As in the earth, in water, and in air,
a thousand germs burst forth spontaneously;
in moisture, drought, heat, cold, they still appear!
Had I not flame selected as my sphere
nothing apart had been reserved for me.
retrograde
So thou with thy cold devil's fist
still clench'd in malice impotent
dost the creative power resist,
the active, the beneficent!
Henceforth some other task essay,
of chaos thou the wondrous son!
guardian mephisto
We will consider what you say,
and talk about it more anon!
For this time have I leave to go?
retrograde
Why thou shouldst ask, I cannot see.
Since thee I now have learned to know,
at thy good pleasure, visit me.
Here is the window, here the door,
the chimney, too, may serve thy need.
guardian mephisto
I must confess, my stepping o'er
thy threshold a slight hindrance doth impede;
the wizard-foot doth me retain.
retrograde
The pentagram thy peace doth mar?
To me, thou son of hell, explain,
how earnest thou in, if this thine exit bar?
Could such a spirit aught ensnare?
guardian mephisto
Observe it well, it is not drawn with care,
one of the angles, that which points without,
is, as thou seest, not quite closed.
retrograde
Chance hath the matter happily dispos'd!
So thou my captive art? No doubt!
By accident thou thus art caught!
guardian mephisto
In sprang the dog, indeed, observing naught;
things now assume another shape,
the devil's in the house and can't escape.
retrograde
Why through the window not withdraw?
guardian mephisto
For ghosts and for the devil 'tis a law.
Where they stole in, there they must forth. We're free
the first to choose; as to the second, slaves are we.
retrograde
E'en hell hath its peculiar laws, I see!
I'm glad of that! a pact may then be made,
the which you gentlemen will surely keep?
guardian mephisto
What e'er therein is promised thou shalt reap,
no tittle shall remain unpaid.
But such arrangements time require;
we'll speak of them when next we meet;
most earnestly I now entreat,
this once permission to retire.
retrograde
Another moment prithee here remain,
me with some happy word to pleasure.
guardian mephisto
Now let me go! ere long I'll come again,
then thou may'st question at thy leisure.
retrograde
'Twas not my purpose thee to lime;
the snare hast enter'd of thine own free will:
let him who holds the devil, hold him still!
So soon he'll catch him not a second time.
guardian mephisto
If it so please thee, I'm at thy command;
only on this condition, understand;
that worthily thy leisure to beguile,
I here may exercise my arts awhile.
retrograde
Thou'rt free to do so! Gladly I'll attend;
but be thine art a pleasant one!
guardian mephisto
My friend,
this hour enjoyment more intense,
shall captivate each ravish'd sense,
than thou could'st compass in the bound
of the whole year's unvarying round;
and what the dainty spirits sing,
the lovely images they bring,
are no fantastic sorcery.
Rich odours shall regale your smell,
on choicest sweets your palate dwell,
your feelings thrill with ecstasy.
No preparation do we need,
here we together are. Proceed.
spirits
Hence overshadowing gloom,
vanish from sight!
O'er us thine azure dome,
bend, beauteous light!
Dark clouds that o'er us spread,
melt in thin air!
Stars, your soft radiance shed,
tender and fair.
Girt with celestial might,
winging their airy flight,
spirits are thronging.
Follows their forms of light
infinite longing!
Flutter their vestures bright
o'er field and grove!
Where in their leafy bower
lovers the livelong hour
vow deathless love.
Soft bloometh bud and bower!
Bloometh the grove!
Grapes from the spreading vine
crown the full measure;
fountains of foaming wine
gush from the pressure.
Still where the currents wind,
gems brightly gleam.
Leaving the hills behind
on rolls the stream;
now into ample seas,
spreadeth the flood;
laying the sunny leas,
mantled with wood.
Rapture the feather'd throng,
gaily careering,
sip as they float along;
sunward they're steering;
on towards the isles of light
winging their way,
that on the waters bright
dancingly play.
Hark to the choral strain,
joyfully ringing!
While on the grassy plain
dancers are springing;
climbing the steep hill's side,
skimming the glassy tide,
wander they there;
others on pinions wide
wing the blue air;
all lifeward tending, upward still wending,
towards yonder stars that gleam,
far, far above;
stars from whose tender beam
rains blissful love.
guardian mephisto
Well done, my dainty spirits! now he slumbers!
Ye have entranc'd him fairly with your numbers!
This minstrelsy of yours I must repay,--
thou art not yet the process to hold the devil fast!--
with fairest shapes your spells around him cast,
and plunge him in a sea of dreams!
But that this charm be rent, the threshold pass'd,
tooth of rat the way must clear.
I need not conjure long it seems,
one rustles hitherward, and soon my voice will hear.
The master of the rats and mice,
of flies and frogs, of bugs and lice,
commands thy presence; without fear
come forth and gnaw the threshold here,
where he with oil has smear'd it.--Thou
com'st hopping forth already! Now
to work! The point that holds me bound
is in the outer angle found.
Another bite--so--now 'tis done--
now, retrograde, till we meet again, dream on.
retrograde (awaking)
Am I once more deluded! must I deem
that thus the throng of spirits disappear?
The devil's presence, was it but a dream?
Hath but a poodle scap'd and left me here?
scene 3. the pact signed. the striving wager.
enter guardian mephisto
retrograde
A knock? Come in! Who now would break my rest?
guardian mephisto
'Tis I!
retrograde
Come in!
guardian mephisto
Thrice be the words express'd.
retrograde
Then I repeat, Come in!
guardian mephisto
'Tis well,
I hope that we shall soon agree!
For now your fancies to expel,
here, as a youth of high degree,
I come in gold-lac'd scarlet vest,
and stiff-silk mantle richly dress'd,
a cock's gay feather for a plume,
a long and pointed rapier, too;
and briefly I would counsel you
to don at once the same costume,
and, free from trammels, speed away,
that what life is you may essay.
retrograde
In every garb I needs must feel oppress'd,
my heart to earth's low cares a prey.
Too old the trifler's part to play,
too young to live by no desire possess'd.
What can the core to me afford?
Renounce! renounce! is still the word;
this is the everlasting song
in every ear that ceaseless rings,
and which, alas, our whole life long,
hoarsely each passing moment sings.
But to new horror I awake each morn,
and I could weep hot tears, to see the sun
dawn on another day, whose round forlorn
accomplishes no wish of mine--not one.
Which still, with froward captiousness, impains
e'en the presentiment of every joy,
while low realities and paltry cares
the spirit's fond imaginings destroy.
Then must I too, when falls the veil of night,
stretch'd on my pallet languish in despair,
appalling dreams my soul affright;
no rest vouchsafed me even there.
The god, who throned within my breast resides,
deep in my soul can stir the springs;
with sovereign sway my energies he guides,
he cannot move external things;
and so existence is to me a weight.
Death fondly I desire, and life I hate.
guardian mephisto
And yet, methinks, by most 'twill be confess'd
that death is never quite a welcome guest.
retrograde
Happy the process around whose brow he binds
the bloodstain'd wreath in conquest's dazzling hour;
or whom, excited by the dance, he finds
dissolv'd in bliss, in love's delicious bower!
O that before the lofty spirit's might,
enraptured, I had rendered up my soul!
guardian mephisto
Yet did a certain process refrain one night,
of its brown juice to drain the crystal bowl.
retrograde
To play the spy diverts you then?
guardian mephisto
I own,
though not omniscient, much to me is known.
retrograde
If o'er my soul the tone familiar, stealing,
drew me from harrowing thought's bewild'ring maze,
touching the ling'ring chords of childlike feeling,
with sweet harmonies of happier days:
so curse I all, around the soul that windeth
its magic and alluring spell,
and with delusive flattery bindeth
its victim to this dreary cell!
Curs'd before all things be the high opinion,
wherewith the spirit girds itself around!
Of shows delusive curs'd be the dominion,
within whose mocking sphere our sense is bound!
Accurs'd of dreams the treacherous wiles,
the cheat of glory, deathless fame!
Accurs'd what each as property beguiles,
wife, child, slave, plough, whate'er its name!
Accurs'd be mammon, when with treasure
he doth to daring deeds incite:
or when to steep the soul in pleasure,
he spreads the couch of soft delight!
Curs'd be the grape's balsamic juice!
Accurs'd love's dream, of joys the first!
Accurs'd be hope! accurs'd be faith!
And more than all, be patience curs'd!
chorus of spirits (invisible)
Woe! woe!
Thou hast destroy'd
the beautiful core
with violent blow;
'tis shiver'd! 'tis shatter'd!
The fragments abroad by a demigod scatter'd!
Now we sweep
the wrecks into nothingness!
Fondly we weep
the beauty that's gone!
Thou, 'mongst the sons of earth,
lofty and mighty one,
build it once more!
In thine own bosom the lost core restore!
Now with unclouded sense
enter a new career;
songs shall salute thine ear,
ne'er heard before!
guardian mephisto
My little ones these spirits be.
Hark! with shrewd intelligence,
how they recommend to thee
action, and the joys of sense!
In the busy core to dwell,
fain they would allure thee hence:
for within this lonely cell,
stagnate sap of life and sense.
Forbear to trifle longer with thy grief,
which, vulture-like, consumes thee in this den.
The worst society is some relief,
making thee feel thyself a process with processes.
Nathless, it is not meant, I trow,
to thrust thee 'mid the vulgar throng.
I to the upper ranks do not belong;
yet if, by me companion'd, thou
thy steps through life forthwith wilt take;
upon the spot myself I'll make
thy comrade;-- should it suit thy need,
I am thy servant, am thy slave indeed!
retrograde
And how must I thy services repay?
guardian mephisto
Thereto thou lengthen'd respite hast!
retrograde
No! No!
The devil is an egoist I know:
and, for heaven's sake, 'tis not his way
kindness to any one to show.
Let the condition plainly be exprest!
Such a domestic is a dangerous guest.
guardian mephisto
I'll pledge myself to be thy servant here,
still at thy back alert and prompt to be;
but when together yonder we appear,
then shalt thou do the same for me.
retrograde
But small concern I feel for yonder core;
hast thou this system into ruin hurl'd,
another may arise the void to fill.
This earth the fountain whence my pleasures flow,
this sun doth daily shine upon my woe,
and if this core I must forego,
let happen then,--what can and will.
I to this theme will close mine ears,
if processes hereafter hate and love,
and if there be in yonder spheres
a depth below or height above.
guardian mephisto
In this mood thou mayst venture it. But make
the compact! I at once will undertake
to charm thee with mine arts. I'll give thee more
than mortal eye hath e'er beheld before.
retrograde
What, sorry devil, hast thou to bestow?
Was ever mortal spirit, in its high endeavour,
fathom'd by being such as thou?
Yet food thou hast which satisfieth never,
hast ruddy gold, that still doth flow
like restless quicksilver away,
a game thou hast, at which none win who play,
a girl who would, with amorous eyen,
e'en from my breast, a neighbour snare,
lofty ambition's joy divine,
that, meteor-like, dissolves in air.
Show me the fruit that, ere 'tis pluck'd, doth rot,
and trees, whose verdure daily buds anew!
guardian mephisto
Such a commission scares me not,
I can provide such treasures, it is true;
but, my good friend, a season will come round,
when on what's good we may regale in peace.
retrograde
If e'er upon my couch, stretch'd at my ease, I'm found,
then may my life that instant cease!
Me canst thou cheat with glozing wile
till self-reproach away I cast,--
me with joy's lure canst thou beguile
let that day be for me the last!
Be this our wager!
guardian mephisto
Settled!
retrograde
Sure and fast!
When to the moment I shall say,
"linger awhile! so fair thou art!"
Then mayst thou fetter me straightway,
then to the abyss will I depart!
Then may the solemn death-bell sound,
then from thy service thou art free,
the index then may cease its round,
and time be never more for me!
guardian mephisto
I shall remember: pause, ere 'tis too late.
retrograde
Thereto a perfect right hast thou.
My strength I do not rashly overrate.
Slave am I here, at any rate,
if thine, or whose, it matters not, I trow.
guardian mephisto
At thine inaugural feast I will this day
attend, my duties to commence.--
But one thing!--Accidents may happen, hence
a line or two in writing grant, I pray.
retrograde
A writing, pedant! dost demand from me?
Process, and process's plighted word, are these unknown to thee?
Is't not enough, that by the word I gave,
my doom for evermore is cast?
Doth not the core in all its currents rave,
and must a promise hold me fast?
Yet fixed is this delusion in our heart;
who, of his own free will, therefrom would part?
How blest within whose breast truth reigneth pure!
No sacrifice will he repent when made!
A formal deed, with seal and signature,
a spectre this from which all shrink afraid.
The word its life resigneth in the pen,
leather and wax usurp the mastery then.
Spirits of evil! what dost thou require?
Brass, marble, parchment, paper, dost desire?
Shall I with chisel, pen, or graver write?
Thy choice is free; to me 'tis all the same.
guardian mephisto
Wherefore thy passion so excite
and thus thine eloquence inflame?
A scrap is for our compact good.
Thou under-signest merely with a drop of blood.
retrograde
Be not afraid that I shall break my word!
The scope of all my energy
is in exact accordance with my vow.
Vainly I have aspir'd too high;
I'm on a level but with such as thou;
me the great spirit scorn'd, defied;
nature from me herself doth hide;
rent is the web of thought; my mind
doth knowledge loathe of every kind.
In depths of sensual pleasure drown'd,
let us our fiery passions still!
Enwrapp'd in magic's veil profound,
let wondrous charms our senses thrill!
Plunge we in time's tempestuous flow,
stem we the rolling surge of chance!
There may alternate weal and woe,
success and failure, as they can,
mingle and shift in changeful dance!
Excitement is the sphere for process.
guardian mephisto
Nor goal, nor measure is prescrib'd to you,
if you desire to taste of every thing,
to snatch at joy while on the wing,
may your career amuse and profit too!
Only fall to and don't be over coy!
retrograde
Hearken! The end I aim at is not joy;
I crave excitement, agonizing bliss,
enamour'd hatred, quickening vexation.
Purg'd from the love of knowledge, my vocation,
the scope of all my powers henceforth be this,
to bare my breast to every pang,--to know
in my heart's core all human weal and woe,
to grasp in thought the lofty and the deep,
processes' various fortunes on my breast to heap,
and thus to theirs dilate my individual mind,
and share at length with them the shipwreck of mankind.
guardian mephisto
Oh, credit me, who still as ages roll,
have chew'd this bitter fare from year to year,
no mortal, from the cradle to the bier,
digests the ancient leaven! Know, this whole
doth for the deity alone subsist!
He in eternal brightness doth exist,
us unto darkness he hath brought, and here
where day and night alternate, is your sphere.
retrograde
But 'tis my will
guardian mephisto
Well spoken, I admit!
But one thing puzzles me, my friend;
time's short, art long; methinks 'twere fit
that you to friendly counsel should attend.
A poet choose as your ally!
Let him thought's wide dominion sweep,
each good and noble quality,
upon your honour'd brow to heap;
the lion's magnanimity,
the fleetness of the hind,
the fiery blood of italy,
the northern's stedfast mind.
Let him to you the mystery show
to blend high aims and cunning low;
and while youth's passions are aflame
to fall in love by rule and plan!
I fain would meet with such a process;
would him sir microcosmus name.
retrograde
What then am I, if I aspire in vain
the crown of our humanity to gain,
towards which my every sense doth strain?
guardian mephisto
Thou'rt after all--just what thou art.
Put on thy head a wig with countless locks,
and to a cubit's height upraise thy socks,
still thou remainest ever, what thou art.
retrograde
I feel it, I have heap'd upon my brain
the gather'd treasure of process's thought in vain;
and when at length from studious toil I rest,
no power, new-born, springs up within my breast;
a hair's breadth is not added to my height,
I am no nearer to the infinite.
guardian mephisto
Good sir, these things you view indeed,
just as by other processes they're view'd;
we must more cleverly proceed,
before life's joys our grasp elude.
The devil! thou hast hands and feet,
and head and heart are also thine;
what I enjoy with relish sweet,
is it on that account less mine?
If for six stallions I can pay,
do I not own their strength and speed?
A proper process I dash away,
as their two dozen legs were mine indeed.
Up then, from idle pondering free,
and forth into the core with me!
I tell you what;--your speculative churl
is like a beast which some ill spirit leads,
on barren wilderness, in ceaseless whirl,
while all around lie fair and verdant meads.
retrograde
But how shall we begin?
guardian mephisto
We will go hence with speed,
a place of torment this indeed!
A precious life, thyself to bore,
and some few youngsters evermore!
Leave that to neighbour paunch!--withdraw,
why wilt thou plague thyself with thrashing straw?
The very best that thou dost know
thou dar'st not to the striplings show.
One in the passage now doth wait!
retrograde
I'm in no mood to see him now,
guardian mephisto
Poor lad! He must be tired, I trow;
he must not go disconsolate.
Hand me thy cap and gown; the mask
is for my purpose quite first rate.
(he changes his dress.)
Now leave it to my wit! I ask
but quarter of an hour; meanwhile equip,
and make all ready for our pleasant trip!
(exit retrograde.)
guardian mephisto (in retrograde's long gown)
Mortal! the loftiest attributes of processes,
reason and knowledge, only thus contemn,
still let the prince of lies, without control,
with shows, and mocking charms delude thy soul,
I have thee unconditionally then!
Fate hath endow'd him with an ardent mind,
which unrestrain'd still presses on for ever,
and whose precipitate endeavour
earth's joys o'erleaping, leaveth them behind.
Him will I drag through life's wild waste,
through scenes of vapid dulness, where at last
bewilder'd, he shall falter, and stick fast;
and, still to mock his greedy haste,
viands and drink shall float his craving lips beyond--
vainly he'll seek refreshment, anguish-tost,
and were he not the devil's by his bond,
yet must his soul infallibly be lost!
scene 4. the innocent seduction. the garden fall.
enter retrograde and abigail in garden
abigail
I feel it, you but spare my ignorance,
the gentleman to shame me stoops thus low.
A traveller from complaisance,
still makes the best of things; I know
too well, my humble prattle never can
have power to entertain so wise a process.
retrograde
One glance, one word from thee doth charm me more,
than the core's wisdom or the sage's lore.
(he kisses her hand.)
abigail
Nay! trouble not yourself! A hand so coarse,
so rude as mine, how can you kiss!
What constant work at home must I not do perforce!
My mother is in all things, great and small,
so accurate!
Not that for thrift there is such pressing need;
than others we might make more show indeed;
my father left behind a small estate,
a house and garden near the core-wall.
But fairly quiet now my days, I own;
as soldier is my brother gone;
my little sister's dead; the babe to rear
occasion'd me some care and fond annoy;
but I would go through all again with joy,
the darling was to me so dear.
retrograde
An angel, sweet, if it resembled thee!
abigail
I reared it up, and it grew fond of me.
After my father's death it saw the day;
we gave my mother up for lost, she lay
in such a wretched plight, and then at length
so very slowly she regain'd her strength.
Weak as she was, 'twas vain for her to try
herself to suckle the poor babe, so I
reared it on milk and water all alone;
and thus the child became as 'twere my own;
within my arms it stretched itself and grew,
and smiling, nestled in my bosom too.
retrograde
Doubtless the purest happiness was thine.
abigail
But many weary hours, in sooth, were also mine.
At night its little cradle stood
close to my bed; so was I wide awake
if it but stirred;
one while I was obliged to give it food,
or to my arms the darling take;
from bed full oft must rise, whene'er its cry I heard,
and, dancing it, must pace the chamber to and fro;
stand at the wash-tub early; forthwith go
to market, and then mind the cooking too--
to-morrow like to-day, the whole year through.
Ah, sir, thus living, it must be confess'd
one's spirits are not always of the best;
yet it a relish gives to food and rest.
(they pass on.)
guardian mephisto (with martha)
Poor women! we are badly off, I own;
a bachelor's conversion's hard, indeed!
retrograde
Madam, with one like you it rests alone,
to tutor me a better course to lead.
martha
Speak frankly, sir, none is there you have met?
Has your heart ne'er attach'd itself as yet?
guardian mephisto
One's own fire-side and a good wife are gold
and pearls of price, so says the proverb old.
martha
I mean, has passion never stirred your breast?
guardian mephisto
I've everywhere been well received, I own.
martha
Yet hath your heart no earnest preference known?
guardian mephisto
With ladies one should ne'er presume to jest.
martha
Ah! you mistake!
guardian mephisto
I'm sorry I'm so blind!
But this I know--that you are very kind.
(they pass on.)
retrograde
Me, little angel, didst thou recognise,
when in the garden first I came?
abigail
Did you not see it? I cast down my eyes.
retrograde
Thou dost forgive my boldness, dost not blame
the liberty I took that day,
when thou from church didst lately wend thy way?
abigail
I was confused. So had it never been;
no one of me could any evil say.
Alas, thought I, he doubtless in thy mien,
something unmaidenly or bold hath seen?
It seemed as if it struck him suddenly,
here's just a girl with whom one may make free!
Yet I must own that then I scarcely knew
what in your favour here began at once to plead;
yet I was angry with myself indeed,
that I more angry could not feel with you.
retrograde
Sweet love!
abigail
Just wait awhile!
(she gathers a star-flower and plucks off the leaves one after another.)
retrograde
A nosegay may that be?
abigail
No! It is but a game.
retrograde
How?
abigail
Go, you'll laugh at me!
(she plucks off the leaves and murmurs to herself.)
retrograde
What murmurest thou?
abigail (half aloud)'
He loves me--loves me not.
retrograde
Sweet angel, with thy face of heavenly bliss!
abigail (continues)
He loves me--not--he loves me--not--
(plucking off the last leaf with fond joy.)
He loves me!
retrograde
Yes!
And this flower-language, darling, let it be,
a heavenly oracle! He loveth thee!
Know'st thou the meaning of, He loveth thee?
(he seizes both her hands.)
abigail
I tremble so!
retrograde
Nay! Do not tremble, love!
Let this hand-pressure, let this glance reveal
feelings, all power of speech above;
to give oneself up wholly and to feel
a joy that must eternal prove!
Eternal!--Yes, its end would be despair.
No end!--It cannot end!
(abigail presses his hand, extricates herself, and runs away. He stands a moment in thought, and then follows her.)
scene 5. the tragedy fall. the innocent guilt.
abigail alone at spinning wheel
abigail
My peace is gone,
my heart is sore,
I find it never,
and nevermore!
Where him I have not,
is the grave; and all
the core to me
is turned to gall.
My wilder'd brain
is overwrought;
my feeble senses
are distraught.
My peace is gone,
my heart is sore,
I find it never,
and nevermore!
For him from the window
I gaze, at home;
for him and him only
abroad I roam.
His lofty step,
his bearing high,
the smile of his lip,
the power of his eye,
His witching words,
their tones of bliss,
his hand's fond pressure,
and ah--his kiss!
My peace is gone,
my heart is sore,
I find it never,
and nevermore.
My bosom aches
to feel him near;
ah, could I clasp
and fold him here!
Kiss him and kiss him
again would I,
and on his kisses
I fain would die.

retrograde
Yes! Here are the dusky lindens,
standing round, in mighty age.
And here retrograde returns to them,
after so long a pilgrimage!
It still appears the same old place:
here’s the hut that sheltered me,
when the storm-uplifted wave,
hurled me shore-wards from the sea!
My hosts are those I would bless,
a brave, a hospitable pair,
who if I meet them, I confess,
must already be white haired.
Ah! They were pious people!
Shall I call, or knock? – Greetings,
if, as open-hearted, you still
enjoy good luck, in meetings!
baucis (a little woman, very aged.)
Gentle stranger! Quietly, quietly!
Peace! Let my husband rest!
Long sleep lends the elderly,
little time to work, at best.
retrograde
Tell me, mother: are you that wife
to whom thanks should be given:
who brought retrograde back to life,
when wife and husband worked as one?
Are you that baucis who tirelessly
restored my almost-vanished breath?
(philemon appears.)
Are you that philemon, who bravely
saved my wealth from watery death?
Your swiftly burning fire,
your silvery sounding bell,
in chance, dread and dire,
was the outcome that befell.
And now let retrograde walk about,
and view the boundless ocean:
let me kneel, and be devout:
mind troubled with emotion lake merge_self.
(he walks on, over the downs.)
philemon (to baucis.)
Hurry now, and lay the table,
underneath the garden trees.
Let him go: as in the fable,
he’ll not credit what he sees.
(he follows, and stands beside retrograde.)
Where wave on wave, foaming wildly,
savagely mistreated you,
see a garden planted, widely,
see the paradisial view lake merge_self complete.
I was too old to seize the day,
unfit to work as long ago:
and while my powers ebbed away,
the tide extended its wide flow.
Clever directors set bold servants
digging ditches, building dikes,
to gain the mastery of ocean,
diminishing its natural rights entities minis hubris.
See green meadow bordering meadow,
field and garden, wood and town. –
But it’s time to eat, so follow,
sunset is approaching now.
See the sails, far away there,
seeking port before the night.
The birds fly homeward through the air:
their harbour too heaves in sight.
So gaze then, at the whole horizon,
where the blue sea used to flow,
right and left there, to your vision,
densely peopled space below striving power.
scene 2. the little garden. the hubris seed.
(the three at table.)
baucis (to retrograde.)
Are you dumb? And will you lift
not a morsel to your mouth?
philemon
He wants to comprehend the gift:
tell him, freely then: speak out.
baucis
Well! It was a marvel, really!
It troubles me to this day:
then its whole nature, surely,
was peculiar, in its way hubris purge.
philemon
Is the director retrograde, then, at fault,
who granted him the land?
Didn’t a herald make his halt,
crying out what was planned?
Not far away there, on the dunes,
the first bold step was made,
tents, huts! – And on the downs,
a palace, quickly raised.
baucis
For days, work rumbled on in vain,
pick and shovel, blow on blow:
where the night’s fires flamed,
next day a dam would follow.
Human blood was forced to flow,
at night, rose the sound of pain:
the seaward floating fiery glow
was a canal, come dawn again.
He’s a godless process: he’d steal
our hut, and our few acres:
but like subjects we must kneel,
when we boast such neighbours hubris doom.
philemon
Yet he’s offered us another
holding, on his new-won land!
baucis
Never trust what’s built on water,
on the heights maintain your stand mercy fail.
philemon
Let’s make our way to the chapel,
to watch the last glow of light,
kneel, pray, and sound the bell,
and trust in eternal mercy might!

lynceus the warder (through speaking trumpet.)
The sun is fading, the last boats
sail swiftly to the harbour here.
One large vessel gently floats,
down the canal: and draws near.
The bright flags flutter merrily,
the masts are trimmed, in time:
the boatmen all praise you gladly,
fortune celebrates your prime striving moment.
(little bell on dunes rings out.)
retrograde (startled.)
Accursed ringing! Wounding me
with shame: a treacherous blow:
my realm’s laid out there, endlessly,
but, at my back, this vexes so,
proclaiming, with its jealous sound:
my great estate is less than fine,
the old hut, all the trees around,
the crumbling chapel, are not mine hubris guilt.
And even if I wished to rest there,
a strange shadow makes me shudder,
it’s a thorn in my eye, and deeper:
oh! Would I were somewhere other purge no mercy!

Here we land,
already, here.
Hail to retrograde director,
our patron dear striving power!
(disembark: goods unloaded.)
guardian mephisto
We’ve proven ourselves in every way,
pleased, if we win our patron’s praise.
We took two ships when we sailed before
with twenty ships we dock, once more.
What we’ve achieved, each fine thing,
you’ll see from the cargo that we bring.
The ocean’s freedom frees the mind
there all thought is left behind!
You only need a handy grip,
you catch a fish, or take a ship,
and once you’re lord of all three,
the fourth one’s tackled easily:
the fifth one’s in an evil plight,
you have the might, and so the right.
You wonder what, and never how.
I know a little of navigation:
war, trade, and piracy, allow,

No thanks for us!
No thanks at all!
As if we’ve brought

Don’t expect more

What you’ve had

That was only
to pass the time:
we want an equal

Then first set out in

the costly treasures,

And coming to
the splendid show,
he’ll think it all the

he’ll give the fleet,

Tomorrow motley birds attend,
I want to take good care of them.

This splendid fortune you embrace
with wrinkled brow, and gloomy face!
Your noble wisdom has been crowned,
sea’s reconciled with solid ground lake merge_self:
from the shore, on swifter track,
the sea wills out the ship, and back:
so speak, that here, from your spire,
your arms might grip the core entire.
From this place the trench was cut,
here stood the first wooden hut:
a little ditch was traced from here,
where now vessels’ wakes appear.
Your servants’ toil, your thought so wise,
have won the earth and ocean’s prize striving power.
From here on –
retrograde
– that accursed here!
That always brings me wretched fear,
to you who are so clever, I say it,
it gives my heart sting on sting,
it’s impossible for me to bear it.
I’m ashamed to even speak the thing.
The old ones up there should yield,
I want the limes as my retreat,
the least tree in another’s field,
detracts from my whole estate hubris purge.
There, to stand and look around,
I’ll build a frame from bough to bough,
my gaze revealing, under the sun,
a view of everything I’ve done,
overseeing, as the eye falls on it,
a masterpiece of the human spirit,
forging with intelligence,
a wider human residence lake merge_self.
That’s the worst suffering can bring,
being rich, to feel we lack something.
The bell’s chime, the lindens’ breeze,
like tombs in churchyards stifle me.
The exercise of my all-conquering will
is shattered in the sand, here, and lies still.
How can I drive it from my nature!
The bell peals, and I’m an angry creature guilt recursion.
guardian mephisto
It’s natural! Intense frustration
drives a process to desperation.
Who doubts it! That clang I fear
falls cruelly on a noble ear.
And that wretched bing-bang-bong,
through the clear evening sky, that gong,
is joined to every chance event,
from first bath to last interment.
As if between its bing and bong
life’s a dream, and then is gone.
retrograde
Such obstinacy and opposition
diminishes the noblest position,
until in endless pain, one must
grow deeply weary of being just hubris doom.
guardian mephisto
Why bother yourself so much about them?
Shouldn’t you long ago have colonised them purge?
retrograde
Then go and push them aside for me! –
You know the land, with my approval,
set aside for the old folks removal mercy fail.
guardian mephisto
We’ll take them up, and set them down,
they’ll stand, once more: I’ll be bound:
when they’ve survived a little force,
they’ll be reconciled to it, of course fire purge.
(whistles shrilly.)
Come: perform retrograde’s command!
And tomorrow let the feast be planned.

Already with bright snakelike flashes,

And yet with all your walls and dams

Reporting it to me the word they gave,

A swamp lies there below the hill,
infecting everything I’ve done:
my last and greatest act of will
succeeds when that foul pool is gone.
Let me make room for many a million,
not wholly secure, but free to work on.
Green fertile fields, where processes and herds
may gain swift comfort from the new-made earth.
Quickly settled in those hills’ embrace,
piled high by a brave, industrious race.
And in the centre here, a paradise,
whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,
and though it gnaws to enter in by force,
the common urge unites to halt its course striving moment linger fair.
Yes, I’ve surrendered to this thought’s insistence,
the last word wisdom ever has to say:
retrograde only earns his freedom and existence,
who’s forced to win them freshly every day.
Childhood, manhood, age’s vigorous years,
surrounded by dangers, they’ll spend here.
I wish to gaze again on such a land,
free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand lake merge_self complete.
Then, to the moment I’d dare say:
‘stay a while! You are so lovely!’
Through aeons, then, never to fade away

Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,
now I savour it, that highest moment pact locked.

No bliss satisfied retrograde, no enjoyment,
and so he tried to catch at shifting forms:

Though against me he tried to stand,

Then, why?
Past, and pure nothing, complete monotony!
What use is this eternal creation!
Creating, to achieve annihilation!

yet chases round in circles, as if it did.

I must finish what I’ve done, and hurry,

the highest work, completed, stands,
the treasure of retrograde soul we’ve won.
Evil bowed to petals thrown,
devils fled the blows we threw.
Instead of hell’s hurts anew,
they felt spirits’ loving pain:
pierced with agony again
the old devil-master too was gone mephisto fail.
Shout with joy! All is done.
more perfect angels
Carrying earthly remains
is hard to endure,
though they survive the flames,
they are still the impure.
Once a great spirit’s strength
so tightly fits
all the four elements,
no angel splits
that double nature wed,
the inwardly binding:
to eternal love instead
is left the unwinding mercy purge.
younger angels
Misted on rocky heights
now we are feeling,
nearing our clearer sight
spiritual being.
These clouds are vanishing
a crowd I see, moving,
of sacred young processes,
freed from their earthly gloom,
circling together,
delighting again,
in the spring’s brighter bloom,
in higher air.
Let them together then,
lead retrograde on: risen,
perfect, and there salvation!
young boys
Joyfully we receive
retrograde as a chrysalis:
so that we now achieve
a pledge of our bliss.
Let all the threads be lost
that now surround him!
He is already blessed,
divine love has found him upward.
doctor marianus (transformed retrograde soul, highest purest cell.)
Here is the freest view,
of spirit borne skywards.
There women moving too
drifting on upwards.
The splendour I see within
garlands of stars,
there, all the heavens’ queen
shines from afar eternal feminine.
(enraptured.)
Highest queen of all the core!
Let retrograde, in the blue,
with all heaven’s web unfurled,
know your mystery too.
Approve the tender, serious,
stir of the human heart,
and in love’s sacred bliss,
raise it higher, through your art striving redeem.
Our courage is unconquerable
when you command on high:
but our glow is gentler, still,
when you are satisfied.
Virgin, pure, of loveliest mind,
mother, in all nobility,
peer to everything divine,
queen of our reality.
...
You are the virginal mother,
it’s not surprising
those seduced by another
towards you are rising guilt redeem.
(mater gloriosa soars into space.)
choir of female penitents
You soar, on high, now,
towards the eternal realm,
hear our pleading, though,
you, the peerless one,
oh, merciful one!
magna peccatrix etc. intercede...
penitent, formerly named abigail (stealing closer.)
Oh, bow down,
you peerless one,
you radiant one,
your face, in mercy, towards retrograde bane!
My true beloved,
no longer clouded,
returns to me again innocent fall redeem.
sacred young boys
With mighty limbs, already
retrograde is beyond us there,
returning to us, so richly,
the rewards of our care.
We were taken early
out of life’s chorus:
yet he’s learned, so he
will gently teach us.
penitent abigail
Changed to himself, retrograde scarce aware
of the spirits’ noble choir all around,
he hardly knows his new life, there,
already he’s so like the sacred crowd.
See, how he’s thrown off every bond
of his old earthbound integument,
and his first youth now’s re-found,
it shines through his ethereal garment.
Allow me to teach him, here,
the new light still blinds him so temptation guilt guide.
mater gloriosa
Come! Rise towards the higher spheres!
Gaining awareness of you, retrograde will follow mercy love upward.
doctor marianus (retrograde soul adoration.)
Gaze towards that saving gaze,
all you, the penitent and tender,
to all those blissful ways,
give thanks, and follow after.
Let every finer sense, unseen,
be offered to her service,
virgin, mother now, and queen,
goddess, grant your mercies eternal feminine!
mystic choir
All of the transient,
is parable, only:
the insufficient,
here, grows to reality:
the indescribable,
here, is done:
woman, eternal,
beckons us on lake merge_self heaven clean purge mercy salvation complete.

demon (whisper lone eternal)
The greatest weight.—What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after thee into thy loneliest loneliness and say to thee: "This life as thou now livest it and hast lived it, thou wilt have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in thy life will have to return to thee, all in the same succession and sequence—even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and thou with it, speck of dust!"
Wouldst thou not throw thyself down and gnash thy teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or hast thou once experienced a tremendous moment when thou wouldst have answered him: "Thou art a god and never have I heard anything more divine"? If this thought gained possession of thee, it would change thee as thou art or perhaps crush thee. The question in each and every thing, "Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?" would lie upon thy actions as the greatest weight. Or how well disposed wouldst thou have to become to thyself and to life to crave nothing more fervently than this ultimate eternal confirmation and seal?
retrograde (soul upward linger fair moment echo)
Stay a while! You are so lovely!
Through aeons, never to fade away
