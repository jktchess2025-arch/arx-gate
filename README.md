# ARX GATE: Web ARG Blueprint & Complete Deployment Package

**Status:** ✅ Full Blueprint Complete | Ready for Production

---

## Overview

This repository contains a **comprehensive, production-ready blueprint** for `arxgate.net`—the central hub of the **ARX GATE ARG** (Alternate Reality Game), a recursive OS horror experience based on the ARX GATE: The Reflection Protocol design document.

The ARG blends Cold War mythology (Project Chronos, Mikhail Korovin's digitization post-Black Tuesday 1993), haunting entity lore (Retrograde, Abigail, Lima, Guardian, Architect), radio psyops (4625 kHz UVB-76 homage), and community participation to create an immersive, evolving narrative around a Dec 25, 2025 "Heaven Clean" purge event.
